### News!

*We have transitioned to a new home for our user forum, after Yahoo shut down all
their forums on extremely short notice and deleted all posted content!*

The new forum is hosted at Discourse, the link to it is at the bottom of this
page. This is a way more polished and featureful discussion group system, so
it should also provide improved usability. We have to figure out all the new
bells and whistles ourselves, but all the basics should be ready.

People signed up to the old forum may have to (re-)sign up for the new Discourse
forum. Much of the old content from the old YahooGroups forum has been imported
into the new forum.

The Psychtoolbox user community is quite active. The old Yahoo Groups forum had
2,810 subscribers at the time of its shutdown by Yahoo at the end of October 2019,
and received 24136 messages during its lifetime from 17th January 2000 to 28th
October 2019. We hope the new forum will show as much user engagement, now that
it is reestablished since January 2020.

<!--- Disable - It is a bit pointless to show info that is multiple years outdated by now.
