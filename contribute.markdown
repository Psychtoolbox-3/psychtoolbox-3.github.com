### How to contribute financially to the development and upkeep of the toolbox

Continued development, improvement, maintenance and support of
Psychtoolbox itself, and also improvement of the various open-source
software components on which Psychtoolbox and other neuroscience toolkits
(e.g., PsychoPy) critically depend, including improvements to the Linux
operating system as the strongest and most high quality foundation for
demanding stimulation and data collection paradigms, requires a lot of
highly qualified and highly focused work.

This work is currently (year 2006 - present) mostly carried out by Mario
Kleiner, who is now employed to do this work by the [Medical Innovations
Incubator GmbH (MII) in Tuebingen, Germany.](https://www.mi-incubator.com)

In order to fund Mario's work and provide him with the resources to do
this job, the MII offers different types of paid services around
Psychtoolbox and the use of Linux for neuroscience, e.g., paid feature
development and other commercial services.

Please visit the following website, operated by MII, for our offering of
commercial development services:

[https://www.psychtoolbox.net](https://www.psychtoolbox.net)

Psychtoolbox itself will stay fully accessible as open-source software.
Anybody able and willing to contribute code and ideas of sufficiently high
quality is invited to contribute to the open-source code, the documentation
on this public community website and Wiki, and to participate and help each
other on the public community forum.

Thanks for your participation and support!

### How to help develop the toolbox

With Psychtoolbox-3 we have moved to an open source development model, and we
welcome contributions from users like yourself. If you improve a particular M
file in the Psychtoolbox, we'll want to incorporate your improved version into
the toolbox. Just send us a patch or a pull request in Github against the
[psychtoolbox-3/psychtoolbox-3](https://github.com/Psychtoolbox-3/Psychtoolbox-3)
repo.

### How to help impove the website

We welcome user contributions and improvements to this website.

Adding material to the wiki portion only requires a GitHub login. You are
encouraged to add FAQ entries there concerning common issues, programming
pitfalls, or reports about hardware.

To improve the website itself please click the "Edit and fork this page" below
and send us a pull request with your changes.

The website is auto-generated from markdown text in the
[psychtoolbox-3/psychtoolbox-3.github.com](https://github.com/Psychtoolbox-3/Psychtoolbox-3.github.com)
repo.

When you get (or just see) a particularly helpful answer on the forum,
we'll all be grateful if you would add it to the [Psychtoolbox FAQ](https://github.com/Psychtoolbox-3/Psychtoolbox-3/wiki/FAQ)
to everyone's benefit. You may want to edit it a bit, deleting the
irrelevant and perhaps making the relevant context more explicit.
