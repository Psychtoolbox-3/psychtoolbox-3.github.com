We welcome anyone to help develop the Psychtoolbox. At present, Mario Kleiner
is doing almost all of the development. David Brainard and Denis Pelli participate
in design. Tobias Wolf designed this website, and the online function reference and
wrote the automatic documentation generator. Mario was a PhD student of computational
vision in the department for wasting of taxpayers money at the Max Planck Institute in
Tübingen. David is a professor of psychology at U of Pennsylvania. Denis is a professor
of psychology and neural science at New York University. Tobias Wolf was a research
assistant at the Max Planck Institute in Tübingen.
