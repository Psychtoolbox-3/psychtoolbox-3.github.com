# [GetChar](GetChar)
##### >[Psychtoolbox](Psychtoolbox)>[PsychBasic](PsychBasic)

[ch, when] = [GetChar](GetChar)([getExtendedData], [getRawCode])  
  
Wait for a typed character and return it.  If a character was typed  
before calling [GetChar](GetChar) then [GetChar](GetChar) will return that character immediatly.  
Characters flushed by [FlushEvents](FlushEvents) are all ignored by [GetChar](GetChar). Characters  
are returned in the first return argument "ch".  
  
Please read the 'help ListenChar' carefully to understand various  
limitations and caveats of this function, and to learn about - often  
better - alternatives.  
  
CAUTION: Do not rely on the keypress timestamps returned by [GetChar](GetChar)  
without fully reading and understanding this help text. Run your own  
timing tests on [GetChar](GetChar) and [KbCheck](KbCheck) to verify that the timing is good  
enough and avoid [GetChar](GetChar) for timed keypresses if possible at all. Use  
[KbWait](KbWait) and [KbCheck](KbCheck) instead.  
  
The main purpose of [GetChar](GetChar) is to reliably collect keyboard input in the  
background while your experiment script is occupied with performing other  
operations, e.g., Matlab computations, sound output or visual stimulus  
drawing. After an initial call to [ListenChar](ListenChar), the operating system will  
record all keyboard input into an internal queue. [GetChar](GetChar) removes  
characters from that queue, one character per invocation of [GetChar](GetChar). You  
can empty that queue any time by calling [FlushEvents](FlushEvents)('keyDown').  
  
If you want to check the current state of the keyboard, e.g., for  
triggering immediate actions in response to a key press, waiting for a  
subjects response, synchronizing to keytriggers (e.g., fMRI machines) or  
if you require high timing precision then use [KbCheck](KbCheck) instead of [GetChar](GetChar).  
  
[GetChar](GetChar) should work on all platforms, but its specific functionality,  
beyond simply returning typed characters, will vary depending on OS type  
and version, if you use Matlab or Octave, and if you use Matlab with or  
without Java based GUI active. For portability it is therefore best to  
ignore all info returned beyond the character code.  
  
"when" is a struct. It (used to) return the time of the keypress, the "adb"  
address of the input device, and the state of all the modifier keys  
(shift, control, command, option, alphaLock) and the mouse button.  
"when.secs" is an estimate, of what [GetSecs](GetSecs) would have been. Since it's  
derived sometime from a timebase different from the timebase of [GetSecs](GetSecs),  
times returned by [GetSecs](GetSecs) are not directly comparable to when.secs.  
  
By setting getExtendedData to 0, all extended timing/modifier information  
will not be collected and "when" will be returned empty.  This speeds up  
calls to this function. If ommitted or set to 1, the "when" data  
structure is filled.  getRawCode set to 1 will set "ch" to be the integer  
ACII code of the available character.  If ommitted or set to 0, "ch" will  
be in char format. When running under Linux in "matlab -nojvm" mode or on  
Octave, "when" will be returned empty. When running on any other  
operating system under Octave or in "matlab -nojvm" mode, or on Windows  
Vista and later versions of the Windows OS, when will only contain a  
valid timestamp, but all other fields will be meaningless.  
  
[GetChar](GetChar) and [CharAvail](CharAvail) are character-oriented (and slow), whereas [KbCheck](KbCheck)  
and [KbWait](KbWait) are keypress-oriented (and fast). If only a meta key (like  
<option\> or <shift\>) was hit, [KbCheck](KbCheck) will return true, because a key was  
pressed, but [CharAvail](CharAvail) will return false, because no character was  
generated. See [KbCheck](KbCheck).  
  
[CharAvail](CharAvail) and [GetChar](GetChar) use the system event queue to retrieve the character  
generated, not the raw key press(es) per se. If the user presses "a",  
[GetChar](GetChar) returns 'a', but if the user presses option-e followed by "a",  
this selects an accented a, "?", which is treated by [GetChar](GetChar) as a single  
character, even though it took the user three keypresses (counting the  
option key) to produce it.  
  
There can be some delay between when the key is pressed and when [CharAvail](CharAvail)  
or [GetChar](GetChar) detects it, due to internal processing overhead in Matlabs Java  
implementation. [GetChar](GetChar) internally collects timestamps in the timebase  
used by Matlabs Java implementation, whereas other Psychtoolbox timing functions  
[(GetSecs]((GetSecs), [Screen](Screen)('[Flip](Flip)'), [KbCheck](KbCheck), [KbWait](KbWait), ...) use time reported by some  
high precision system timer. The "when.secs" time reported by [GetChar](GetChar) is  
converted from Java timebase to Psychtoolboxs timebase. Due to conversion  
errors mostly out of our control, the reported values can be off by  
multiple dozen or even hundreds of milliseconds from what [KbWait](KbWait), [KbCheck](KbCheck)  
or [GetSecs](GetSecs) would report. Example: A high-end Pentium-4 3.2 Ghz system  
running Windows-XP has been measured to be off by 40 to 70 milliseconds.  
  
Some Java implementations are also known to have problems/bugs in  
timestamping keyboard presses properly and each Matlab version on each  
operating system is bundled with a different Java version, so some Matlab  
versions may be reliable with respect to [GetChars](GetChars) timing, whereas others  
are not.  
  
---\> If precise timing of the keypress is important, use [KbCheck](KbCheck) or  
[KbWait](KbWait) or [KbQueueXXX](KbQueueXXX) functions or [KbEventGet](KbEventGet) for consistent results!  
  
### OS X / Windows-XP / Linux (non-KDE desktop GUI) with Matlab and Java enabled:  
  
JAVA PATH: The [GetChar](GetChar) implementation for Matlab is based on Java.  
Therefore, the Psychtoolbox subfolder [PsychJava](PsychJava) must be added to Matlabs  
static classpath. Normally this is done by the Psychtoolbox installer by  
editing the Matlab file "classpath.txt" (enter which('classpath.txt') to  
find the location of that file). If the installer fails to edit the file  
properly, you'll need to perform that step manually by following the  
instructions of the installer. See 'help PsychJavaTrouble' for more infos  
on this.  
  
KEYSTROKES IN THE BACKGROUND: To detect keypresses made before the  
[GetChar](GetChar) call, you must have called "[ListenChar](ListenChar)" earlier.  [ListenChar](ListenChar)  
redirects keystrokes to the [GetChar](GetChar) queue. Calling [ListenChar](ListenChar) at the  
beginning of your script should cause [GetChar](GetChar) to behave identically  
to OS 9 [GetChar](GetChar) with respect to background keystroke collection.  
  
KEYSTROKES IN MATLAB WINDOW: By default, all keystrokes are also sent to  
Matlabs window, generating some ugly clutter. You can suppress this by  
calling [ListenChar](ListenChar)(2), so your Matlab console stays nice and clean. Don't  
forget to call [ListenChar](ListenChar)(1) or [ListenChar](ListenChar)(0) though before the end of  
your script. If Matlab returns to its command prompt without reenabling  
keyboard input via [ListenChar](ListenChar)(0) or [ListenChar](ListenChar)(1), Matlab will be left  
with a dead keyboard until you press the CTRL+C key combo. This silencing  
of clutter does currently not work in matlab -nojvm mode, or if you use  
GNU/Octave instead of Matlab.  
  
OTHER "when" RETURN ARGUMENT FIELDS: Owing to differences in what  
accessory information the underlying operating systems provides about  
keystrokes, "when' return argument fields differs between operating systems.  
[GetChar](GetChar) sets fields for which it returns no value to the value 'Nan'.
