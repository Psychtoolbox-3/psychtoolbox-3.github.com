[LinuxGameMode](LinuxGameMode) - How to setup Linux performance optimizations via "gamemode"  
  
You may have arrived here because [Priority](Priority)() instructed you to go here if  
you want to enable a couple of extra performance optimizations for your  
Linux system, to increase graphics and compute performance and further improve  
realtime behaviour for demanding experimental paradigms.  
  
The "gamemode" package is an optional Linux package, developed by the gaming  
company "Feral Interactive". It is meant to automatically optimize a Linux  
system for high performance in demanding video games. Luckily for us, the same  
optimizations that help high-end video games can also help the performance of  
demanding psychophysics paradigms, especially for low-latency sound and hardware  
input/output and high-performance graphics and visual stimulation.  
  
When your script executes the [Priority](Priority)(n) command with a priority level n \> 0,  
ie. realtime priority, Psychtoolbox will check if the gamemode package is  
installed and properly set up on your Linux system. If so, it will ask the  
gamemode package to switch your Linux system into "Game mode", until [Priority](Priority)(0)  
is executed, clear [Screen](Screen), clear mex, or clear all is executed, or Octave/Matlab  
is quit.  
  
Switching to gamemode should disable screen savers and screen lockers and various  
power saving features which can impair performance. It will switch the cpu into  
high-performance, high power consumption mode (by switching the cpu governor  
to "performance" mode) for minimal processing latency and maximum speed. It will  
give Psychtoolbox extra priority for any input/output, e.g., disc access or other  
hardware access. Optionally, if set in a configuration file, it will enable  
additional realtime scheduling optimizations on top of Psychtoolbox optimizations,  
and optionally it will tune supported graphics cards for high performance mode,  
e.g., all recent [NVidia](NVidia) gpu's with the proprietary driver, and all modern AMD  
gpu's with the amdgpu or amdgpu-pro open-source or hybrid drivers.  
  
The "gamemode" package is not installed by default, but you can get recent  
versions for some Ubuntu Linux distributions from the following sources:  
  
For Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 18.10 and 19.04 you can get up to date packages from the  
following privately contributed, inofficial and \*untrusted\* PPA:  
  
https://launchpad.net/~samoilov-lex/+archive/ubuntu/gamemode  
  
Please note that the above ppa is not reviewed by Ubuntu for correctness  
and could in theory contain malicious code that would execute with admin  
permissions on your system. So you have to trust the producer of that ppa  
if you decide to install it.  
  
Alternatively, you can also download the latest version of the gamemode package  
source code, and compile and install it from its upstream source yourself:  
  
https://github.com/[FeralInteractive](FeralInteractive)/gamemode  
  
There you will also find documentation for extended setup of the package, e.g.,  
an example .ini configuration file for additional performance tuning of gpu's:  
  
https://github.com/[FeralInteractive](FeralInteractive)/gamemode/blob/master/example/gamemode.ini  
  
If you run [PsychLinuxConfiguration](PsychLinuxConfiguration) it will offer you to install a gamemode.ini  
file into your system which is already optimally set up for high-performance  
use with Psychtoolbox.  
  
Note that users of a multi-gpu system, e.g., a hybrid-graphics laptop, may need  
to edit the /etc/gamemode.ini file manually after installation, as the config  
file encodes the card number of the graphics card to optimize. On a dual-gpu  
system, the default card number 0 may be wrong and would need to be changed  
manually to 1 by you.
