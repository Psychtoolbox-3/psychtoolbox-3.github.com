[RaspberryPiSetup](RaspberryPiSetup) -- How to setup your Pi optimally for Psychtoolbox.  
  
There are two major families of the [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) with features suitable for  
meaningful use for visual and auditory stimulation with Psychtoolbox-3, the  
older variants [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) 2 and 3, and the new [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) 4/400 family.  
  
Psychtoolbox is currently only tested with up to date versions of the official  
[RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) Linux operating system distribution known as "[RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) OS", also  
known under its former name "Raspbian". Only 32-Bit Raspbian is supported by  
Psychtoolbox as provided directly by us via [DownloadPsychtoolbox](DownloadPsychtoolbox) et al., even  
on 64-Bit processors. Whatever is the most recent stable Raspbian + GNU/Octave  
is what PTB will support, with some jiggle room, as we do not keep close track  
of development an updates to Raspbian. Raspbian itself also provides versions  
of Psychtoolbox, installable via "sudo apt install octave-psychtoolbox-3", and  
64-Bit versions of Raspbian would ship such packages as 64-Bit packages. Other  
Linux distributions for [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi), like Ubuntu for [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi), will also  
ship Psychtoolbox packages as 32-Bit or 64-Bit variants via the sudo apt install  
octave-psychtoolbox-3 method. While these packages will likely work just fine,  
these are currently not tested by the Psychtoolbox developers, or supported in  
case of questions or problems. These packages are maintained by the [NeuroDebian](NeuroDebian)  
maintainers, and they are usually quite a bit out of date wrt. the current PTB  
beta releases, as the Linux distributions usually ship whatever PTB was the most  
recent version at a time sometime before the distributions was released. Those  
packages do not get updates after initial distribution release, not even bug  
fixes. E.g., Raspbian at early 2021 ships some Psychtoolbox 3.0.15 variant,  
whereas PTB betas are now at version 3.0.17 or later.  
  
  
The [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) 2B is tested for compatibility with Psychtoolbox. The test system  
is a [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) 2B with 1 GB of RAM. Other models of [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) 2 and 3 are  
expected to work equally well (or better for the more powerful [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) 3),  
but not tested. It provides:  
  
- 40 pin digital i/o, e.g., for TTL trigger emission or reception, hardware  
  interfacing etc. See [RaspberryPiGPIODemo](RaspberryPiGPIODemo).m for how to use it.  
  
- Working stereo audio output with ok latency and good timing via the headphone  
  jack. Tested and verified by use of a [VPixx](VPixx) Datapixx. Working audio output or  
  input via UAC compliant USB audio cards.  
  
- Working video capture with external USB connected web cams.  
  
- Single display support via HDMI for up to 1920x1080 pixels full HD, with 8 bit  
  of color precision, for standard 24 bit color depth / 16.8 Millions of colors,  
  or 256 levels of red, green, blue, grey. No support for floating point framebuffers  
  or textures, and thereby no support for stimulus drawing or post-processing  
  which would require such buffers.  
  
  
The [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) 4, and its keyboard form-factor variant [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) 400, apart  
from providing more RAM and faster processor and graphics, do support:  
  
- 40 pin digital i/o, e.g., for TTL trigger emission or reception, hardware  
  interfacing etc. See [RaspberryPiGPIODemo](RaspberryPiGPIODemo).m for how to use it. Untested so far,  
  but should work the same as on the [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) 2 and 3.  
  
- Presumably working stereo output like the [RPi](RPi) 2 and 3 on models with headphone  
  jack. This is untested by us so far, but reasonable to assume it is working.  
  
- Audio output via HDMI audio: This is tested to be working for video playback  
  with the Chrome webbrowser, and with Psychtoolbox built-in [[GStreamer](GStreamer)][(GStreamer)]((GStreamer)) based  
  movie/video/audio playback engine. You can play back movies with sound, or  
  sound files in common formats like .wav or .mp3 or .ogg audio etc., whatever  
  is supported by [[GStreamer](GStreamer)][(GStreamer]((GStreamer))'s collection of plugins.  
  
  CAUTION: Audio output over HDMI via our [PsychPortAudio](PsychPortAudio) driver currently does  
  not work at all! Audio output over headphone jacks - if any - is supposed to  
  work, but not tested. Working audio output or input via UAC compliant USB audio  
  cards.  
  
- Working video capture with external USB connected web cams.  
  
- Dual-display support via two micro-HDMI connectors up to 4k UHD resolution.  
  So far tested is single-display operation, due to lack of a 2nd adapter cable.  
  
  The new [VideoCore](VideoCore)-6 gpu has slightly higher performance than the older [VideoCore](VideoCore)  
  4 gpu in [RPi](RPi) 2 and 3. More importantly, the gpu supports full 32 bit floating  
  point framebuffers and textures, with the restriction that framebuffer blending/  
  alpha-blending is only supported on 16 bit floating point framebuffers. This  
  opens up many new use cases for more complex visual stimuli, e.g., it makes  
  [AdditiveBlendingForLinearSuperpositionTutorial](AdditiveBlendingForLinearSuperpositionTutorial).m demo work, as well as  
  [MorphDemo](MorphDemo) and [MorphTextureDemo](MorphTextureDemo), [FDFDemo](FDFDemo), [GarboriumDemo](GarboriumDemo) and [ProceduralGarboriumDemo](ProceduralGarboriumDemo)  
  and various other complex shader-based or alpha-blending based stimuli. It also  
  allows to take full advantage of high-end visual stimulators and display devices  
  from [VPixx](VPixx), if you are inclined enough to drive a multi-thousand dollar stimulator  
  with a 50$ microcomputer. Ofc. while accuracy is excellent, performance is more  
  limited than with a desktop or laptop graphics card from Intel, AMD or [NVidia](NVidia).  
  Testing showed that stimuli generated without use of alpha-blending can be output  
  at the full 16 bit or 14 bit precision of [VPixx](VPixx) or CRS visual stimulators, while  
  stimuli created via alpha blending with 16 bit floating point framebuffers can  
  achieve up to 11 bit precision, depending on specific stimulus.  
  
  Movie playback of full HD video at 24 fps is possible with suitably encoded  
  movies and proper playback settings. For playback of H264 encoded movies, the  
  builtin H264 hardware decoder of the [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) 4 is used. You must specify  
  an explicit 'pixelFormat' of 6 in [Screen](Screen)('OpenMovie', ...., pixelFormat); for  
  this to work at good performance for high resolution movies. At default settings  
  movie playback would be very slow, e.g., 1-2 fps for full HD content. Additionally,  
  the H264 hardware decoder is picky wrt. proper content encoding. While footage  
  e.g., from [YouTube](YouTube) or other professionally encoded sources works, badly encoded  
  footage may not. Regrettably our own included demo movie [DualDiscs](DualDiscs).mov, as used  
  by [SimpleMovieDemo](SimpleMovieDemo) and [PlayMoviesDemo](PlayMoviesDemo) by default, does not work at all, the  
  decoder chokes on it. Many other movie formats play back with software decoding,  
  at potentially lower performance. To summarize: Good performance playback of HD  
  content at good framerates works if you do everything right wrt. playback parameters  
  and encoding. Otherwise your mileage may vary both wrt. performance and reliability.  
  
  
###   If you use Psychtoolbox with Raspbian, these setup steps are strongly recommended:  
  
  1. Update your Raspbian to the latest version "sudo apt update" and "sudo apt upgrade".  
  
  2. If you are on a [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) 4 or 400, make sure the Linux kernel is at least of  
     version 5.10 or later. If "uname -a" reports a lower version, upgrade the kernel  
     via "sudo rpi-update" and some reboot. This step is not needed for the [RPi](RPi) 2 and 3.  
  
  3. Switch from the firmware kms video driver to the proper fully open-source kms  
     video driver. For this, edit the file /boot/config.txt - the section at the end,  
     then reboot. The section should look like this on a [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) 4 / 400:  
  
     [pi4]  
     \# Enable DRM VC4 V3D driver on top of the dispmanx display stack  
     dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d-pi4  
     max\_framebuffers=2  
     gpu\_mem=256  
  
     [all]  
     gpu\_mem=256  
  
     You could increase gpu\_mem to numbers larger than 256 MB if you run into  
     graphics performance trouble or other glitches. Important for proper visual  
     stimulation with proper timing and reliability is that the dtoverlay parameter is  
     set to vc4-kms-v3d-pi4 instead of vc4-fkms-v3d.  
  
     On a [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) 2 or 3, the dtoverlay parameter should be vc4-kms-v3d instead  
     of vc4-fkms-v3d.  
  
  4. On the [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) 4 / 400 with editions of Raspbian / [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) OS older than  
     February 2021, you should either update your OS to the latest, and reboot, or run  
     [PsychLinuxConfiguration](PsychLinuxConfiguration), [XOrgConfCreator](XOrgConfCreator), and [XOrgConfSelector](XOrgConfSelector) to install a custom  
     xorg.conf file, which will work around a bug in Raspbian. Reboot! If the bug is  
     present and this workaround from step 4 is not applied, Psychtoolbox will complain  
     angrily about "pageflipping not being used for flips", visual stimulation timing  
     will be grossly wrong, and you will observe massive tearing artifacts, flicker and  
     other stimulus anomalies.  
  
  With all setup steps performed propery, and a reboot for good measure, visual  
  stimulation should work very well, with robust, trustworthy and sub-millisecond  
  accurate visual stimulus onset timestamps, as verfied by us with external measurement  
  equipment.  
  
  
  In general, the [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) microcomputers are quite capable devices for neuroscience  
  testing, even for many vision science paradigms. Their builtin gpio support makes them  
  especially nifty if one needs to receive or send TTL triggers or other i/o.  
  
  Further support for improvements to Psychtoolbox wrt. [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) devices, and  
  user support will be contingent on labs financially supporting our work. Until  
  then, consider this work being done on a low effort basis.
