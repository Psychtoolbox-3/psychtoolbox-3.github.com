[OculusVR](OculusVR) - How to setup the drivers for Oculus VR products.  
  
Psychtoolbox supports Virtual Reality Head mounted displays,  
(VR-[HMDs)](HMDs)) and some other hardware from Oculus VR LLC.  
  
Note: Oculus VR's trademarks, e.g., Oculus, Oculus Rift, etc.  
are registered trademarks owned by Oculus VR, LLC.  
  
# Oculus Rift CV-1 and later models from Oculus on Windows  
  
The more recent Oculus Rift CV1 and Oculus Touch controllers, or more  
generally, Oculus VR hardware supported by the Oculus SDK and Oculus  
runtime v1.16 and later can be utilized with the newer [PsychOculusVR1](PsychOculusVR1)()  
driver. This requires use of an operating system and hardware platform  
supported by the Oculus runtime v1.16 or later. Currently the  
[PsychOculusVR1](PsychOculusVR1)() driver is known to work successfully on 64-Bit Microsoft  
Windows 7 and later for 64-Bit Intel compatible processors, with suitable  
graphics cards from AMD and [NVidia](NVidia). Use of the latest stable version of  
Windows 10 is recommended, as the driver is best tested on that system and  
Windows 10 is supposed to provide best VR performance and quality due to  
operating system features not present in earlier Windows versions. You will  
need to have the Oculus VR runtime version 1.16 or later installed and setup  
correctly for the driver to work.  
  
# Oculus Rift CV-1 and later models from Oculus on Linux  
  
Limited experimental support for the Oculus Rift CV1 on Linux is available  
by use of the [PsychOpenHMDVR](PsychOpenHMDVR)() driver, which utilizes [OpenHMD](OpenHMD) to drive the  
device. Functionality and display quality is substantially limited compared to  
use of the [PsychOculusVR1](PsychOculusVR1)() driver though. See "help [PsychOpenHMDVR](PsychOpenHMDVR)".  
  
# Oculus Rift DK-1 and DK-2 on Linux, macOS, Windows  
  
Currently the older Oculus Rift DK1 and Oculus Rift DK2 are supported  
by Psychtoolbox on the 64-Bit editions of GNU/Linux, Apple OSX and  
Microsoft Windows-7 and later, both under 64-Bit GNU/Octave and  
64-Bit Matlab by use of the [PsychOculusVR](PsychOculusVR)() driver. This by use of  
the Oculus v0.5 SDK for these operating system platforms.  
  
In order to use such a HMD you need to install the Oculus VR  
runtime version 0.5.0.1 (-beta) for your operating system.  
This will not work with earlier or later versions of the runtime!  
  
The sdk and runtime for Linux is part of the Psychtoolbox [GitHub](GitHub) and can be  
downloaded from the following folder:  
  
https://github.com/Psychtoolbox-3/Psychtoolbox-3/tree/master/[PsychSourceGL](PsychSourceGL)/Cohorts/[OculusSDK](OculusSDK)  
  
Due to filesize limits of [GitHub](GitHub) unfortunately we weren't able to bundle the [SDKs](SDKs) and  
runtimes for macOS and Windows in the same way. In the past those runtimes could be  
downloaded from:  
  
https://developer.oculus.com/downloads  
  
You had to select "Legacy", and the version as "0.5.0.1-beta"  
in the drop down menus. Then download the "Oculus Runtime for OSX",  
"Oculus Runtime for Windows", or "Oculus SDK for Linux (experimental)"  
and follow the installation and setup instructions contained in those  
installers / [SDKs](SDKs).  
  
Unfortunately this option no longer exists as of July 2021, so if you need those  
runtimes, you have to go on a hunt on the internet or maybe check on the Psychtoolbox  
forum if some kind user still would have a copy of it for you.  
  
Once the 0.5.0.1 runtime is installed according to instructions, and the HMD is  
properly connected via HDMI video and the USB ports for headset and tracking  
camera (in case of the Rift DK2), Psychtoolbox should detect the HMD and  
make use of it.  
  
# Display setup for Rift DK-1/DK-2 with the legacy 0.5.0.1 runtime on Windows  
  
On Windows this works with "Extended Desktop" mode.  
  
Display setup for Rift DK-1/DK-2 with the legacy 0.5.0.1 runtime on Linux/X11,  
# or for the Oculus Rift CV-1 and later with the [OpenHMD](OpenHMD) runtime on Linux/11  
  
On Linux it works on a regular dual display setup, if your machine uses a Linux  
kernel of version 4.15 or earlier. On a modern distribution with a later kernel,  
or generally for best performance and timing you should set up a separate X-[Screen](Screen)  
for the Rift display. The Psychtoolbox/[PsychHardware](PsychHardware)/[LinuxX11ExampleXorgConfs](LinuxX11ExampleXorgConfs)  
subfolder contains an example xorg.conf files for setting up dual-X-screen setups  
for Linux, with the GUI on X-[Screen](Screen) 0 and the Rift on X-[Screen](Screen) 1. You will need  
to adapt the example file to your specific setup though. Running without a desktop  
compositor or the desktop compositor disabled may give another performance boost  
on Linux with not so high end cards.  
  
Our current experience shows that the Rift DK2 works best for more  
complex 3D VR scenes on Linux or Windows. Performance on OSX was much  
lower and the setup less reliable in general, as most things on macOS.  
  
If you want to write portable code that makes use of VR headsets, and  
not only of the Oculus Rift, but also future headsets from Oculus or  
from other vendors, then use only the functions of the [PsychVRHMD](PsychVRHMD)()  
driver. It is expected to work also on future [HMDs](HMDs) and [HMDs](HMDs) of other  
vendors, once they become available. For use of Oculus Rift specific  
features you may need to use the [PsychOculusVR](PsychOculusVR)() driver directly, but  
for most usage scenarios that should not be neccessary.  
  
Before use of the HMD, please read the "Health and safety instructions"  
carefully. They are included in the Psychtoolbox/[PsychDocumentation](PsychDocumentation)/  
folder as file Oculus\_Health\_and\_Safety\_Warnings.pdf. This file is  
provided as part of the Oculus SDK runtime and included here for  
your convenience.  
  
The Oculus Rift runtime also comes with a setup tool named "[RiftConfigUtil](RiftConfigUtil)"  
that allows to adapt the rendering of stimuli to the properties of your  
subject, e.g. the interpupillary distance between both eyes.  
  
  
# Some demos to get you started  
  
[VRHMDDemo](VRHMDDemo) -  Shows how to use a HMD as a regular monoscopic display  
             monitor via [VRHMDDemo](VRHMDDemo)(0), or as a stereoscopic display  
             via [VRHMDDemo](VRHMDDemo)(1), or simply [VRHMDDemo](VRHMDDemo). As you can see,  
             only one line of code is needed to setup a single HMD  
             properly as monoscopic or stereoscopic monitor "strapped  
             to the subjects head". Mono and stereo stimulus presentation  
             is done like in any other mono or stereo Psychtoolbox script.  
  
Various PTB stereo demos demonstrate use of [HMDs](HMDs), e.g, [ImagingStereoDemo](ImagingStereoDemo)(103)  
for a random dot stereo display, [ImagingStereoMoviePlayer](ImagingStereoMoviePlayer)(moviefile, 103) for  
playback of stereoscopic movies.  
  
The most interesting use is use of the [HMDs](HMDs) head tracking to render complex 3D  
stimuli via [OpenGL](OpenGL) which can be navigated by the subjects head movements.  
Enabling an existing 3D stereoscopic script to use the HMD and make use of head  
tracking is a task that requires only a few more lines of code and can be  
accomplished in less than 15 minutes. The following demos demonstrate this use  
of the HMD: [MorphDemo](MorphDemo) for rendering a morphing 3D object, [SuperShapeDemo](SuperShapeDemo) for  
rendering a complex organic "[SuperShape](SuperShape)", [VRHMDDemo1](VRHMDDemo1) for rendering of the  
spinning Utah teapot in 3D, with head movement and mouse control of observer  
location and looking direction. [VRHMDDemo1](VRHMDDemo1) also shows a few optimizations to  
get best performance for more complex scenes.  
  
More such demos will follow in the future.  
  
If you want to immerse your subjects in realistic 3D worlds, you can  
do this by use of the [Horde3DForPsychtoolbox](Horde3DForPsychtoolbox) toolbox which allows you  
to use the [Horde3D](Horde3D) graphics engine with Psychtoolbox. That toolbox also  
supports VR [HMDs](HMDs), as demonstrated in the demo named "[HordeVRHMDDemo1](HordeVRHMDDemo1)",  
which immerses you in a complex 3D VR scene and allows you to navigate  
it via mouse movements and head movements.  
  
You can get the [Horde3DForPsychtoolbox](Horde3DForPsychtoolbox) addon toolkit from [GitHub](GitHub) as  
git checkout or as a downloadable zip file:  
  
https://github.com/kleinerm/[Horde3DForPsychtoolbox](Horde3DForPsychtoolbox)  
  
More such demos for full VR environments as part of Horde will follow  
in the future.  
  
Enjoy your immersion into new (virtual) worlds!
