# [Screen('Rect')](Screen-Rect) 
##### [Psychtoolbox](Psychtoolbox)>[Screen](Screen).{mex*} subfunction

rect=Screen('Rect', windowPointerOrScreenNumber [, realFBSize=0]);

Get local rect of window, texture or screen. This has its top-left corner always  
at (0,0) and encodes the useable size of the window or screen. E.g., in certain  
stereo display modes or other special output modes, the actual useable window  
area for stimulus drawing may be much smaller than the real area occupied by the  
window. Example: In interleaved stereo modes, the effective useable height of a  
window is only half the real height of the window. Use this function to get the  
actual useable drawing area for a window or screen.  
If the optional 'realFBSize' flag is set to 1, then the function returns the  
real size of the windows framebuffer. This is mostly for Psychtoolbox internal  
use, not for regular user-code.
