If you are using a Psychtoolbox variant and version that requires a paid  
software license key to function, e.g., on Microsoft Windows, or Apple  
macOS, or for Matlab on Linux, then a few minutes of basic support per  
year for basic questions may be included in the specific type of software  
license you bought. If at all, when, and how much support will be  
provided is at the sole discretion of the Psychtoolbox team. In any case,  
if you wanted to ask for this basic support, you'd have to present an  
authentication token by running this function, or by calling  
[PsychLicenseHandling](PsychLicenseHandling)('AuthenticationToken').  
  
For paid support beyond that, on the user forum or [GitHub](GitHub) issue tracker,  
you may have bought a "Psychtoolbox paid support membership" in the past.  
If that membership is still valid, then the following procedure would  
allow you to use it:  
  
1. As part of your purchase, you will have received a document - an  
   invoice - with a printed "Order Id" or "Order no.", and a printed "License key".  
  
2. Next you can run \*this\* function [PsychPaidSupportAndServices](PsychPaidSupportAndServices) in Octave or  
   Matlab. The function will ask you if you need paid support and do have  
   an active license key to prove your paid membership. Answer "y" for yes.  
  
3. Next the function will ask you about your "Order Id" and "License key".  
   Please enter that info that you got from step 1.  
  
4. The function will print out an "authentication token", a string of letters and  
   numbers. Now you can post your question on the Psychtoolbox user forum at  
   https://psychtoolbox.discourse.group or open a new issue for bugs and feature  
   requests on our [GitHub](GitHub) issue tracker at the following URL:  
   https://github.com/Psychtoolbox-3/Psychtoolbox-3/issues  
  
   Please add the "authentication token" to your forum question or [GitHub](GitHub) issue.  
   This will prove to us that you deserve paid support for your question or  
   issue. Please note that initial activation of your license key may take 5-10  
   days after date of receipt of payment, so do not buy the paid support last  
   minute, when the "house is already burning", but ahead of time, like you  
   would do with a fire insurance.
