If you require priority support regarding Psychtoolbox, or custom feature  
development (or want to buy a Psychtoolbox themed coffee mug) go to the  
following website which provides such services:  
  
https://www.psychtoolbox.net  
  
  
### For more detailed background information, read on:  
  
Continued development, improvement, maintenance and support of  
Psychtoolbox itself, and also improvement of the various open-source  
software components on which Psychtoolbox and other neuroscience toolkits  
(e.g., [PsychoPy)](PsychoPy)) critically depend, including improvements to the Linux  
operating system as the strongest and most high quality foundation for  
demanding stimulation and data collection paradigms, requires a lot of  
highly qualified and highly focused work.  
  
This work is currently (year 2006 - present) mostly carried out by Mario  
Kleiner, who is now employed to do this work by the Medical Innovations  
Incubator [GmbH](GmbH) (MII) in Tuebingen, Germany (https://www.mi-incubator.com).  
The MII belongs by 100% to the non-profit foundation for medical  
innovations (http://www.mi-foundation.org/) in Tuebingen.  
  
In order to fund Mario's work and provide him with the resources to do  
this job, the MII offers different types of paid services around  
Psychtoolbox and the use of Linux for neuroscience, among them a  
"Psychtoolbox community membership with priority support".  
  
Your lab can now financially contribute to Psychtoolbox sustainability,  
upkeep and continued improvement, by once a year buying such a community  
membership for a modest fee. This membership entitles you to some  
priority support for questions regarding efficient use of Psychtoolbox,  
questions regarding the resolution of issues you may have with it, fixing  
of bugs you may encounter, and feature requests. MII also offers paid  
feature development and other commercial services.  
  
Please visit the following website, operated by MII, for our offering of  
commercial development services, and for the community membership with  
paid priority support:  
  
  
https://www.psychtoolbox.net  
  
  
The membership allows you to get your voice heard by the developers  
regarding future feature development, as well and preferential treatment  
on the public Psychtoolbox user forum and [GitHub](GitHub) issue tracker. Spare  
income generated by your subscription fee, that does not have to be used  
up to process priority requests made individually by you, will be used to  
fund general development and upkeep of Psychtoolbox and its ecosystem. In  
other words, it contributes to / acts as an insurance that allows  
Psychtoolbox to be around and in good shape years into the future.  
  
To clarify: Psychtoolbox itself will stay freely downloadable and useable  
by anyone, and stay fully accessible as open-source software, by anyone  
for any purpose. Anybody able and willing to contribute code and ideas of  
sufficiently high quality is invited to contribute to the open-source  
code, the documentation on our public community website and Wiki  
http://psychtoolbox.org, and to participate and help each other on the  
public community forum https://psychtoolbox.discourse.group.  
  
Faster support on the forum or the bug trackers, or of any support at all  
in times of high developer workload will be reserved to paying community  
members.  
  
Thanks for your participation and support!
