[RaspberryPiGPIODemo](RaspberryPiGPIODemo) - Show basic use of GPIO's on [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi).  
  
Demos full access to the Pi [GPIOs](GPIOs) when running as root,  
slightly more limited access when running as a regular user,  
and also the different setup steps required.  
  
Accessing the [GPIOs](GPIOs) as non-root requires the user account  
to be a member of the Unix group 'gpio'. [PsychLinuxConfiguration](PsychLinuxConfiguration)  
should take care of adding your account if you let it do that  
setup for you. The 'gpio' command line utility allows to configure  
aspects of the [GPIOs](GPIOs) which your code can't control as non-root,  
therefore you'll see multiple system() callouts in this script  
to that helper utility. If the [RPiGPIOMex](RPiGPIOMex) mex file doesn't work  
then you will need to install the 'wiringPi' package to provide  
the required libwiringPi runtime library. On [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi) OS 11 and  
later, wiringPi does not exist anymore, but you may be able to find  
an alternative Debian (armhf) package from the following link:  
  
https://github.com/[WiringPi](WiringPi)/[WiringPi](WiringPi)/releases  
  
Shows digital i/o by flashing/alternating the two  
[LEDs](LEDs) on the [RPi](RPi) 2B, Red power, and green status.  
  
Shows how to efficiently wait for a rising edge  
trigger on Broadcom pin 17, a real GPIO pin on the  
connector. To avoid the need to actually connect  
a switch to the connector, uses internal programmable  
pullup and pulldown resistors to simulate external  
trigger input to the pin.  
  
Please note that the [RPiGPIOMex](RPiGPIOMex) file is just meant as  
a temporary stop-gap solution to get things going, until  
PTB gains a universal I/O driver. Development and support  
of [RPiGPIOMex](RPiGPIOMex) may cease at a future point in time, it may  
even get removed from the distro! Plan accordingly, maybe  
use a M-File wrapper around it to simplify transition to a  
future better I/O driver.  
  
All pin numbers used with [RPiGPIOMex](RPiGPIOMex) are Broadcom GPIO pin  
numbers, not pin numbers on the connector or wiringPi pin numbers!  
  
A nice translation table between connector pins and Broadcom GPIO  
pins can be found on the following website: https://pinout.xyz
