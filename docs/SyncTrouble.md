[SyncTrouble](SyncTrouble) -- Causes and solutions for synchronization problems.  
  
You most probably arrived at this help page because Psychtoolbox  
aborted with "SYNCHRONIZATION FAILURE" or a similar error message and  
asked you to read this page.  
  
BACKGROUND: Why proper synchronization to retrace is important.  
  
When executing [Screen](Screen)('OpenWindow'), Psychtoolbox executes different  
calibration routines to find out if back- and frontbuffer swaps (what  
[Screen](Screen)('[Flip](Flip)') does) are properly synchronized to the vertical retrace  
signal (also known as VBL) of your display. At the same time, it measures  
the real monitor video refresh interval - the elapsed time between two  
VBL signals. It is crucial for flicker free, tear free, properly timed  
visual stimulus presentation that buffer swaps only happen during the VBL  
period of the display. The VBL (vertical blank) is the small gap in time  
that occurs when the display has updated its last scanline and before it  
starts redrawing its display surface starting at the first scanline  
again. This small gap is a neccessity for CRT displays and it is  
preserved for compatibility reasons or other technical reasons on flat  
panels and video beamers. After issuing the [Screen](Screen)('[Flip](Flip)') command, the  
graphics hardware finalizes all pending drawing- and image processing  
operations in the backbuffer of an onscreen window to make sure that the  
final stimulus image is ready in the backbuffer for presentation. Then it  
waits for onset of the next VBL interval before flipp'ing the back- and  
frontbuffer of the onscreen window: The previous backbuffer with your  
newly drawn stimulus becomes the frontbuffer, so it will get scanned out  
and displayed to the subject, starting with the next refresh cycle of  
your display device and on all consecutive refresh cycles, until you draw  
a new stimulus to the onscreen window and update the display again via  
[Screen](Screen)('[Flip](Flip)').  
  
On a properly working system, this double buffer swap happens in less  
than a microsecond, synchronized to VBL onset with an accuracy of better  
than a microsecond. All change of visual content therefore only happens  
during the VBL period when the display is not updating, thereby avoiding  
any kind of visual flicker or tearing that would be caused by a mixup of  
an old stimulus and a new (incompletely drawn) stimulus when changing  
image content during the scanout cycle of the display. The exact point in  
time when this buffer swap happened, is returned as timestamp by the  
[Screen](Screen)('[Flip](Flip)') command. It is the most well defined timestamp of visual  
stimulus onset, and it allows to define stimulus onset of future stims  
relative to this accurate baseline, using the 'when' argument of  
[Screen](Screen)('[Flip](Flip)').  
  
Without proper synchronization, you would see very strong visual flicker  
and tearing artifacts in animated (movie / moving) stimuli, you would not  
have any well defined stimulus onset for sequences of static stimuli or  
rapid stimulus presentation, and no means of synchronizing visual  
stimulus presentation to any external stimulation- or acquisition devices  
like fMRI, EEG, sound, ... You also would not have any accurate way of  
getting a stimulus onset timestamp.  
  
However, if you have very special needs, you can disable either Matlabs /  
Octaves synchronization of execution to the vertical retrace, or you can  
disable synchronization of stimulus onset to the vertical retrace  
completely by setting the 'dontsync' flag of [Screen](Screen)('[Flip](Flip)') accordingly.  
  
For more infos about tearing, see Wikipedia articles about "Tearing",  
"Double buffering", "Vertical Synchronization" and the info pages on  
www.psychtoolbox.org  
  
TESTS: How Psychtoolbox tests for proper synchronization to retrace.  
  
After opening an onscreen window, Psychtoolbox executes a measurement  
loop, where it issues [Screen](Screen)('[Flip](Flip)') commands and measures the time  
elapsed between execution of two consecutive flip commands, getting one  
refresh sample per loop iteration. Each sample is checked for validity:  
Duration must be longer than 4 milliseconds and shorter than 40  
milliseconds, because we assume that none of the available display  
devices updates slower than 25 Hz or faster than 250 Hz. Each sample is  
also tested against the expected value provided by the operating system,  
e.g., if the operating system reports a nominal refresh rate of 100 Hz,  
then a sample should have a duration of roughly 1000 ms / 100 Hz == 10  
milliseconds. We accept any sample in a range of +/- 20% around this  
expected value as valid, because timing jitter present in any computer  
system can cause some deviation from the expected value. Samples that  
don't pass this basic test are rejected. Valid samples are used to update  
a mean value, standard deviation of the mean is also calculated: The  
measurement loop ends when at least 50 valid samples have been taken and  
the standard deviation from the mean is less than 200 microseconds. If it  
is not possible to satisfy this criteria during a five second measurement  
interval, then the calibration is aborted and repeated for up to three  
times. Failure to get a valid measurement during up to three calibration  
runs is indicating massive timing problems or the inability of the  
gfx-hardware to properly synchronize buffer swaps to the vertical  
retrace, or the inability to reliably detect when a buffer swap finished.  
This would lead to abortion with the "SYNCHRONIZATION FAILURE" error  
message. Assuming that this calibration loop did provide a valid mean  
measurement of monitor refresh, the value is checked against the value  
reported by the operating system and - on Windows, and some Linux and macOS  
systems - against the result of an independent measurement loop that uses  
direct queries of rasterbeam positions to measure the monitor refresh interval.  
  
Only if all available measurements yield similar results will the test finally  
be rated as PASSED, Psychtoolbox continues execution, and the computed monitor  
refresh interval is used internally for all built-in timing checks and for  
properly timed stimulus presentation.  
  
### REASONS FOR FAILING THE SYNC TESTS AND HOW TO FIX THEM:  
  
There are multiple classes of possible causes for sync failure. Work down  
this list of causes and solutions until your problem is resolved, or you hit  
the bottom of the list:  
  
1. Wrong configuration settings: This usually only affects MS-Windows  
systems, where the display settings control panel for your graphics card  
allows to customize a couple of graphics driver parameters. Some of these  
settings can cause sync failure if they are wrong:  
  
-\> Make sure the "Synchronize bufferswaps to the vertical retrace" option  
is set to "Application controlled" or "Application controlled, default to  
on". The wording of the option differs between different graphics cards,  
search for something like that. Examples of other names: "Wait for  
vertical sync", "Wait for vertical refresh" ... If this setting is forced  
to off and \*not\* application controlled, then the sync tests will fail  
because the hardware doesn't synchronize its image onset (bufferswap) to  
the video refresh cycle of your display.  
  
-\> Make sure the "Triple buffering" setting is off, or if you can select  
some "Multibuffering" setting, that it is set to "double buffering" or  
"wait for 1 video refresh" or "swap every refresh". This option may not  
exist, but if it does, any other setting will cause the sync tests to  
possibly succeed, but later stimulus onset timestamping to fail with  
errors.  
  
-\> If there is an option "Buffer swap mode" or "Bufferswap strategy", it  
should be set to "Auto select" or "Page flipping" or "Exchange buffers".  
The so called "Copy buffers" or "Blitting" option would result in lower  
performance and wrong/inaccurate timing.  
  
-\> On dual/multi display setups MS-Windows allows you to assign one  
monitor the role of the "primary monitor" or "main monitor" or "primary display".  
It is important that the display device which you use for stimulus presentation  
is this "primary display", otherwise random things may go wrong wrt. sync  
tests and timing.  
  
-\> On all operating systems in dual display or multi display mode, it is  
important that you configure both displays for exactly the same color  
depths, resolution and refresh rate if you want to present stimuli across  
multiple displays, e.g., for binocular stereoscopic presentation on a  
dual-display setup. If there is some option you can choose for "genlocked  
modes" or "genlocked modes only", choose or enable that one. Failing to  
configure dual display setups like this will cause massive timing  
problems or tearing artifacts on one of the display if you do dual  
display stimulation. It may also cause failures in timetamping.  
  
-\> If you use a hybrid graphics laptop, also known as switchable graphics  
laptop, dual-gpu laptop, or by its marketing name "[NVidia](NVidia) Optimus" or  
"AMD Enduro", then read "help [HybridGraphics](HybridGraphics)" on how to set up your Linux  
system for proper timing and performance and to learn how to work around  
massive timing problems that are usually unavoidable on MS-Windows.  
  
2. Temporary timing glitches or system malfunction: It may help to  
restart Matlab/Octave, or to reboot your machine. Sometimes this resolves  
intermittent problems on your system, especially after the system was  
running without reboot for a long time, on high load, or if display  
settings or display configuration has been changed frequently.  
  
  
3. Driver bugs: Many graphics card device drivers have bugs that cause  
synchronization to fail. This is usually only a problem on Apple macOS or  
Microsoft Windows, rarely on Linux with [NVidia](NVidia) proprietary display drivers,  
almost never on Linux with open-source drivers. If none of the above steps  
resolve your problems, check the website of your computer vendor or graphics  
card vendor, or use the "Check for driver updates" function of some operating  
systems to find out if new, more recent graphics drivers have been released  
for your graphics card. If so, update to them. A large number of problems can  
be resolved by a simple driver update.  
  
### 4. Driver/Hardware limitations:  
  
All current systems can't provide reliable research grade timing if you don't  
display your stimuli in opaque fullscreen windows, but use windowed mode or  
transparent mode instead. This can lead to sync failures, wrong/unreliable  
timestamping and other performance problems. Only use non-fullscreen or  
transparent windows for development, debugging and leisure, not for running  
your actual data collection.  
  
Some systems have serious problems if more than one graphics card is connected  
and enabled on the computer. They only work well in single-display mode or multi  
display mode from a single graphics card.  
  
Microsoft Windows may provide poor performance on multi display setups if you  
present on multiple displays simultaneously, although your mileage may vary  
widely depending on exact setup.  
  
On MS-Windows, you will suffer drastic timing problems if the stimulus  
presentation window loses the "keyboard focus". The window with the  
"keyboard focus" is the one which is in the foreground (in front of all other  
windows), has its titlebar highlighted instead of shaded (assuming it has a  
titlebar) and receives all keyboard input, i.e., key presses. Therefore we  
assign "keyboard focus" to our onscreen windows automatically. However, if the  
user clicks into windows other than our window with the mouse, or onto the  
desktop background, or uses key combos like ALT+TAB or Windows+TAB to switch  
between windows, then our window will "lose" the keyboard focus and severe  
timing and performance problems may occur. If any window on the screen is  
highlighted, this means it \*has stolen\* the keyboard focus from our window.  
This weird keyboard focus problem is an unfortunate design decision (or rather  
design flaw) of the MS-Windows graphics subsystem. There isn't anything we or  
the graphics cards vendors could do about it, so you'll have to accept it and  
work around it. Of course this becomes mostly a problem on multi-display setups  
where one display shows the desktop and GUI, and others show Psychtoolbox stimuli,  
so avoid such configurations if you can.  
  
### Further examples:  
  
On all systems, graphics adapters are only capable of properly timed  
bufferswaps and proper visual stimulus onset timestamps syncing to  
retrace if the onscreen window is a full-screen window. Synchronization  
fails if the onscreen window only covers part of the screen (i.e., when  
providing a 'rect' argument to [Screen](Screen)('OpenWindow') other than the  
default full-screen rect). Solution is to only use fullscreen windows for  
stimulus presentation. On Windows, Linux and macOS, graphics cards are  
only capable of synchronizing to the retrace of one display. On a single  
display setup, this will simply work. On a dual display setup, e.g.,  
Laptop connected to external video beamer or CRT, the driver/hardware can  
sync to the wrong output device. A simple, although inconvenient, solution  
is to disable the internal flat panel of a Laptop while running your  
study, so the hardware is guaranteed to sync to the external display.  
The use of "mirror mode", or "clone mode", where multiple displays show the  
same content, will almost always cause timing and performance problems.  
  
5. Graphics system overload: If you ask too much from your poor graphics  
hardware, the system may enter a state where the electronics is not  
capable of performing drawing operations in hardware, either because it  
runs out of video memory ressources, or because it is lacking the  
neccessary features. In that case, some drivers (e.g., on Microsoft  
Windows or [MacOS](MacOS)-X) may activate a software rendering fallback-path: The  
graphics engine is switched off, all rendering is performed by slow  
software in system memory on the cpu and the final image is copied to the  
onscreen framebuffer. While this produces visually correct stimuli,  
presentation timing is completely screwed and not synchronized to the  
monitors refresh at all. On Microsoft Windows, Psychtoolbox will detect  
this case and output some warnings to the Matlab window.  
  
Possible causes of such an overload: Running with anti-aliasing enabled  
at a setting that is too high for the given screen resolution (see 'help  
AntiAliasing'), or running at a display resolution that is too high,  
given the amount of video memory installed on your graphics adapter.  
There may be other cases, although we didn't encounter any of them up to  
now.  
  
Troubleshooting: Try lower display resolutions and multisampling levels,  
or buy a graphics adapter with more onboard memory and performance.  
  
6. General system overload: If you run too many applications on your  
system in parallel to your Psychtoolbox+Matlab/Octave session, then these  
applications may cause significant timing jitter in your system, so the  
execution of Psychtoolbox - and its measurement loops - becomes  
non-deterministic up to the point of being unuseable.  
  
Troubleshooting: Quit and disable all applications and services not  
needed for your study, then retry. The usual suspects are: Virus  
scanners, applications accessing the network or the harddiscs,  
applications like iTunes, system software update...  
  
7. Bad drivers or hardware in your system that interferes with general  
system timing: This is difficult to diagnose. At least on MS-Windows, you  
can download a free tool "dpclat.exe" from the internet. If you run it, it  
will tell you if there are potential problems with your systems timing and  
give hints on how to resolve them.  
  
8. Running inside a Virtual Machine: This almost always causes extremely  
bad timing. The command [PsychTweak](PsychTweak)('PrepareForVirtualmachine') may help by  
disabling most timing tests. This is only useful for demos, not for real  
data collection, of course!

### HOW TO OVERRIDE THE SYNC TESTS:  
  
That all said, there may be occassions where you do not care about  
perfect sync to retrace or millisecond accurate stimulus presentation  
timing, but you do care about running other applications in parallel, or  
getting your stimulus running quickly, e.g., during development and debugging  
of your experiment or when showing a quick online demo of your stimulus  
during a presentation. In these situations you can add the command  
[Screen](Screen)('[Preference](Preference)','SkipSyncTests', 1); at the top of your script,  
before the first call to [Screen](Screen)('OpenWindow'). This will shorten the  
maximum duration of the sync tests to 3 seconds worst case and it will  
force Psychtoolbox to continue with execution of your script, even if the  
sync tests failed completely. Psychtoolbox will still print error  
messages to the Matlab/Octave command window and it will nag about the  
issue by showing the red flashing warning sign for one second. You can  
disable all visual alerts via [Screen](Screen)('[Preference](Preference)','VisualDebugLevel', 0);  
You can disable all output to the command window via [Screen](Screen)('[Preference](Preference)',  
'SuppressAllWarnings', 1);  
  
If your graphics system basically works, but your computer has just very  
noisy timing you can adjust the threshold settings we use for our tests  
via the setting:  
  
[Screen](Screen)('[Preference](Preference)','SyncTestSettings' [, maxStddev=0.001 secs][, minSamples=50][, maxDeviation=0.1][, maxDuration=5 secs]);  
  
'maxStddev' selects the amount of tolerable noisyness, the standard  
deviation of measured timing samples from the computed mean. We default  
to 0.001, ie., 1 msec.  
  
'minSamples' controls the minimum amount of valid measurements to be  
taken for successfull tests: We require at least 50 valid samples by  
default.  
  
'maxDeviation' sets a tolerance threshold for the maximum percentual  
deviation of the measured video refresh interval duration from the  
duration suggested by the operating system (the nominal value). Our  
default setting of 0.1 allows for +/- 10% of tolerance between  
measurement and expectation before we fail our tests.  
  
'maxDuration' Controls the maximum duration of a single test run in  
seconds. We default to 5 seconds per run, with 3 repetitions if  
neccessary. A well working system will complete the tests in less than 1  
second though.  
  
Empirically we've found that especially Microsoft Windows may need some tweaking  
of these parameters, as some of those setups do have rather noisy timing.  
  
  
### MORE WAYS TO TEST:  
  
macOS: The script [OSXCompositorIdiocyTest](OSXCompositorIdiocyTest)() is a "must run" for macOS users,  
to make sure their system doesn't have the macOS compositor bug. If that test  
fails then visual stimulation timing must be considered not trustworthy.  
  
On MS-Windows, you can try [Screen](Screen)('[Preference](Preference)', 'VisualDebugLevel', 6).  
If the onscreen window is subject to desktop composition, which will certainly  
destroy any kind of proper visual stimulation timing, then the window will  
turn invisible if this [VisualDebugLevel](VisualDebugLevel) value is set. Iow. if your window is  
not showing up at all, despite all the status output in your Octave or Matlab  
command window suggesting normal operation, or if the window is disappearing  
in the middle of your data collection session, then this is a clear indication  
that the DWM desktop compositor is active and interfering. It is instructive to  
try this by running a visual stimulation script and then pressing ALT+TAB, or  
clicking into some other application window: Your Psychtoolbox onscreen window  
will lose foreground status, the DWM will kick in and interfere, and this  
diagnostic will cause you window to turn invisible.  
  
Linux: Psychtoolbox has various mechanisms to detect timing problems and will  
almost always provide difficult to ignore warning messages in the Octave or  
Matlab command window. It has the most advanced diagnostic mechanisms to  
protect you against silent failures.  
  
The script [VBLSyncTest](VBLSyncTest)() allows you to assess the timing of Psychtoolbox  
on your specific setup in a variety of conditions. It provides various tweakable  
parameters, and displays a couple of plots at the end, so there is no way  
around reading the 'help VBLSyncTest' if you want to use it.  
  
The script [PerceptualVBLSyncTest](PerceptualVBLSyncTest)() shows some flickering stimulus on the  
screen and allows you to assess visually, if synchronization works  
properly. On Linux there are also [PerceptualVBLSyncTestFlipInfo](PerceptualVBLSyncTestFlipInfo)() and  
[PerceptualVBLSyncTestFlipInfo2](PerceptualVBLSyncTestFlipInfo2)() for further approaches to testing and  
timestamping.  
  
[FlipTimingWithRTBoxPhotoDiodeTest](FlipTimingWithRTBoxPhotoDiodeTest)() allows very extensive testing, by use of  
external measurement equipment. [VRRTest](VRRTest)() allows testing of variable refresh  
display setups - mostly only applicable on Linux.

### LINUX specific tips:  
  
1. Just as on all other operating systems, timed visual stimulus onset  
and stimulus onset timestamping is not reliable for regular (non-  
fullscreen) windows, ie. windows which don't cover the complete desktop of  
a Psychtoolbox screen (also known as X-[Screen](Screen)), or for transparent windows,  
e.g., when the [PsychDebugWindowConfiguration](PsychDebugWindowConfiguration)() command was used. Use of  
rotated display output (90, 180, 270 degrees etc.) or mirror/clone mode  
also prevents proper timing, just as on the other systems. Psychtoolbox  
[PsychImaging](PsychImaging) command and Panelfitter (cfe. [PanelFitterDemo)](PanelFitterDemo)) provide means  
to rotate or scale display output with correctly working timing.  
  
Your windows must be non-transparent, decoration/borderless, fullscreen  
and cover a complete X-Window system X-[Screen](Screen). On a multi-display setup  
that means that either your window must cover all connected displays, or  
you need to setup separate X-Screens in the graphics driver control panel  
GUI, or via a /etc/X11/xorg.conf file for different displays, so that all  
stimulus displays are grouped in one (or multiple) X-[Screen](Screen) which are  
fully covered by your PTB onscreen window, and all other displays, e.g.,  
operator GUI displays, are grouped into a different X-[Screen](Screen). The most  
easy way to set up such a configuration is to use the [XOrgConfCreator](XOrgConfCreator)()  
script, followed by use of the [XOrgConfSelector](XOrgConfSelector)() script.  
  
One source of spurious warnings about "page flipping" not being used, can  
be if your desktop GUI displays some onscreen notification messages, e.g.,  
little popup boxes with messages like "You have new mail!", "New software  
updates available", "Meeting reminder at XXX clock", "Network connection lost",  
... etc. Obviously if this happens during an experiment session, it will cause  
the stimulation onscreen window to be be partially occluded for some time  
by the popup, and that would temporarily impair stimulation timing and print  
one such warning messsage for each [Screen](Screen)('[Flip](Flip)'). Try to disable the notification  
or the source of the notification popup during experiment sessions to avoid this.  
  
Another cause for spurious warnings like these, usually at the startup/beginning  
of your experiment session is low system memory. This prevents the graphics drivers  
from using the optimized page-flipping mode, which is needed for precise timing,  
but requires more memory. The system will try to free up memory and then switch  
to page-flipping, so the warnings go eventually away after a couple of seconds of  
runtime. An indicator that this happened is if the problem goes away on successive  
runs of your experiment, and/or after you've closed unneeded applications, so enough  
free memory is available from the start of your script. This type of low RAM problem  
is especially likely on machines with not much RAM and Intel integrated graphics chips,  
as those depend on enough free system RAM.  
  
2. A major source of timing trouble can be 3D desktop compositors. Either  
use a user interface that doesn't employ a desktop compositor, e.g., the  
GNOME-2 classic 2D desktop, LXDE or XFCE desktop at default settings, or  
configure your desktop compositor of choice to "unredirect\_fullscreen\_windows",  
which will disable the compositor for Psychtoolbox fullscreen windows.  
  
How to configure your desktop compositor to do this? On modern Linux  
distributions, usually no manual steps are required for typical use:  
  
- Ubuntu's GUI doesn't require any setup for "single display single x-screen"  
  setups, or for multi display setups if the visual stimulation display(s) are  
  attached to one or multiple secondary X-Screens (screen 1, 2, ...).  
  
- On other very old and ancient GUI's which use the Compiz compositor, the command ...  
  [PsychGPUControl](PsychGPUControl)('FullScreenWindowDisablesCompositor', 1);  
  ... can do this setup step for you. It is executed automatically during  
  installation of Psychtoolbox, so you usually don't need this command.  
  Multi display stimulation for displays attached to X-[Screen](Screen) 0 may not  
  work properly though, at least as tested long ago on Ubuntu 16.04.0 LTS.  
  In the unlikely case you would want to use such a setup on Compiz, ask on the  
  Psychtoolbox forum for setup help for such legacy desktop environments.  
  
- On GNOME-3, no special setup is required.  
  
- On KDE with a single display setup, usually no special setup is required.  
  
- KDE multi-display setups usually requires some manual configuration:  
  Do this on (K)Ubuntu 14.04 LTS: Open "KDE System Settings" -\>  
  "Display and Monitor" -\> "Compositor" -\> "Allow applications to block compositing"  
  -\> Check the checkbox -\> "Apply" -\> Done.  
  
  If on KDE you still get warnings or errors by PTB related to display timing,  
  or you want maximum graphics performance, you can also try to completely  
  disable desktop composition, either by pressing SHIFT + ALT + F12  
  before the beginning and after the end of your experiment session to  
  completely disable the compositor during the runtime of your experiment  
  script. Or you disable composition completely: In the "KDE System Settings"  
  -\> "Compositor" section, uncheck the "Enable compositor on startup" checkbox,  
  so KDE will start up with its non-composited GUI. This GUI is still very nice  
  looking and ergonomic but frees up additional resources for PTB's graphics  
  and timing requirements.  
  
If you use the [NVidia](NVidia) proprietary graphics drivers, frequent synchronization  
failures, or other sync related warnings, or unsteady, irregularly timed flicker  
during [PerceptualVBLSyncTest](PerceptualVBLSyncTest) indicate that a desktop compositor is in use. On  
Linux with the free and open-source graphics drivers radeon, nouveau or intel,  
PTB will output warnings about non-pageflipped flips in such a case. It will  
also output similar warnings about triple-buffering or one-buffering if the  
proprietary [NVidia](NVidia) driver is recent enough to support detecting this.  
  
3. Another reason for timestamping problems can be the use of  
triple-buffering.  
  
Psychtoolbox would warn you, at least when the free graphics drivers are  
in use, about some error in "[PsychOSGetSwapCompletionTimestamp](PsychOSGetSwapCompletionTimestamp)" and some  
system configuration problems.  
  
The versions of Psychtoolbox since April 2015 can deal with the  
triple-buffering of both the nouveau graphics driver for [NVidia](NVidia) cards,  
and the Intel graphics driver for Intel graphics chips automatically,  
at least for the drivers shipping with Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS and later,  
so no special setup is required for regular experiment scripts. Precise  
visual stimulus onset timing and timestamping is fully compatible with  
the triple-buffering of those open source graphics drivers.  
  
If you happen to have a unusual setup whose triple-buffering still proves  
troublesome for Psychtoolbox visual presentation timing, read on for how  
to disable triple-buffering in the graphics drivers.  
  
Triple-buffering can be disabled with driver specific options in xorg.conf.  
Use the [XOrgConfCreator](XOrgConfCreator) and [XOrgConfSelector](XOrgConfSelector) scripts to easily set up  
your system for optimal timing or multi-display configurations in case.  
These scripts will guide you through the setup.  
  
### For very special needs - if [XOrgConfCreator](XOrgConfCreator) can not do the job for you:  
  
The Psychtoolbox subfolder "[PsychHardware](PsychHardware)/[LinuxX11ExampleXorgConfs](LinuxX11ExampleXorgConfs)/"  
contains a collection of xorg.conf sample files which show how to  
configure your graphics driver for optimal timing, for special  
multi-display configurations, and for high color depth displays. In the  
most simple case you can simply copy a suitable file for your graphics  
card into the /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ directory of your system, under the name  
xorg.conf, ie., ie rename the file to xorg.conf, then copy it into  
/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/  
  
Then logout and login again for the changes to take effect.  
  
For more complex setups you may need to combine snippets of code from  
multiple of our sample files into a single xorg.conf file.
