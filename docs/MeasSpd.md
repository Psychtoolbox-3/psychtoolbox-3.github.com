[spectrum,qual] = [MeasSpd](MeasSpd)([S],[meterType],[syncMode])  
  
This routine splines the raw return values from the  
meter to the wavelength sampling S vector, with  
S = [startWl deltaWl nWlSamples].  
  
The splining handles conversion of power units according to to the  
wavelength sampling deltaWl. That is, power is converted into units of  
power per wlband. This convention, used widely in PTB, means that you can  
omit the multiplication by deltaWl when numerically integrating over  
wavelength, but is a little counterintuitive.  
  
If you later want to spline to other wl samplines, use [SplineSpd](SplineSpd) to  
maintain the PTB convention.  Note that splining to 1 nm spacing puts the  
units into power per nm, as at 1 nm spacing the two conventions are the  
same.  
  
If S is not passed, it is set to [380 5 81].  
  
Tries to handle low light level case gracefully by returning  
zero as the answer.  
  
meterType == 1:  PR650 (default)  
meterType == 4:  PR655  
meterType == 5:  PR670  
meterType == 6:  PR705  
  
syncMode = 'on':  Try to sync integration time with display, if meter supports it (default)  
syncMode = 'off': Don't try to sync, even if meter supports it.
