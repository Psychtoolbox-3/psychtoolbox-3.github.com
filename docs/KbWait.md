# [KbWait](KbWait)
##### >[Psychtoolbox](Psychtoolbox)>[PsychBasic](PsychBasic)

[secs, keyCode, deltaSecs] = [KbWait](KbWait)([deviceNumber][, forWhat=0][, untilTime=inf])  
  
Waits until any key is down and optionally returns the time in seconds  
and the keyCode vector of keyboard states, just as [KbCheck](KbCheck) would do. Also  
allows to wait for release of all keys or for single keystrokes, see  
below.  
  
If the optional parameter 'untilTime' is provided, [KbWait](KbWait) will only wait  
until that time and then return regardless if anything happened on the  
keyboard or not.  
  
CAUTION: [KbWait](KbWait) periodically checks the keyboard. After each failed check  
(ie. no change in keyboard state) it will wait for 5 msecs before the  
next check. This is done to reduce the load on your system, and it is  
important to do so. However if you want to measure reaction times this is  
clearly not what you want, as it adds up to 5 msecs extra uncertainty to  
all measurements!  
  
If you have trouble with [KbWait](KbWait) always returning immediately, this could  
be due to "stuck keys". See "help [DisableKeysForKbCheck](DisableKeysForKbCheck)" on how to work  
around this problem. See also "help [RestrictKeysForKbCheck](RestrictKeysForKbCheck)".  
  
[GetChar](GetChar) and [CharAvail](CharAvail) are character oriented (and slow), whereas [KbCheck](KbCheck)  
and [KbWait](KbWait) are keypress oriented (and fast).  
  
Using [KbWait](KbWait) from the MATLAB command line: When you type "[KbWait](KbWait)" at the  
prompt and hit the enter/return key to execute that command, then [KbWait](KbWait)  
will detect the enter/return key press and return immediatly.  If you  
want to test [KbWait](KbWait) from the command line, then try this:  
  
 [WaitSecs](WaitSecs)(0.2);[KbWait](KbWait)  
  
[KbWait](KbWait) can also wait for releasing of keys instead of pressing of keys  
if you set the optional 2nd argument 'forWhat' to 1.  
  
If you want to wait for a single keystroke, set the 'forWhat' value to 2.  
[KbWait](KbWait) will then first wait until all keys are released, then for the  
first keypress, then it will return. The above example could be realized  
via:  
  
 [KbWait](KbWait)([], 2);  
  
If you would set 'forWhat' to 3 then it would wait for releasing the key  
after pressing it againg, ie. waitForAllKeysReleased -\> waitForKeypress  
-\> waitForAllKeysReleased -\> Return [secs, keyCode] of the key press.

[KbWait](KbWait) uses the [PsychHID](PsychHID) function, a general purpose function for  
reading from the Human Interface Device (HID) class of USB devices.  
  
[KbWait](KbWait) tests a keyboard device by default, which is chosen by an operating  
system dependent heuristic and usually makes a reasonable choice. For better  
control over the keyboard input device, you can pass in a 'deviceNumber' to  
test a different keyboard if multiple keyboards are connected to your machine.  
See the "help [KbCheck](KbCheck)" for [KbCheck](KbCheck) for the meaning of the 'deviceNumber'.
