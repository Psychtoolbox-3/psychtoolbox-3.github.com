[CalibrateMonSpd](CalibrateMonSpd)  
  
Calling script for monitor calibration.  Assumes  
you have [CMCheckInit](CMCheckInit)/[MeasSpd](MeasSpd) functions that initialize  
measurement hardware and return a measured spectral  
power distribution respectively.  
  
NOTE 30-June-2023: I tried to fix some of this mess, to make the functions  
more compatible with the way current operating systems, graphics cards and  
display devices work. Specifically the massive changes in how hardware gamma  
tables work on modern gpu's. I also added support for more Photo Research  
colormeters. This seems to work ok with the simulated meterType 0, but I don't  
have actual measurement hardware to verify if things work as expected. I guess  
it is less broken now, and maybe even working fine, but who knows?  
  
NOTE (dhb, 8/19/12).  This code is a bit dusty, as it is not  
being actively maintained.  In particular, the PTB display   
control has evolved since this was last looked at carefully.  
In general, you want to calibrate through the same set of   
display calls you'll use in your experiment.  Below is some  
prose written by Mario Kleiner that describes how the PTB  
currently wants you to control and restore your clut.  In  
an ideal world, this routine would be updated to match.  But  
more generally, if you use this code you may want to modify  
to make sure it is displaying colors the same way you will in  
your experiments.  The actual work is done in [CalibrateMonDrvr](CalibrateMonDrvr)  
and [CalibrateAmbDrvr](CalibrateAmbDrvr) so that is where you would look.  
  
    We have two functions for this. [LoadIdentityClut](LoadIdentityClut)() for loading an  
    identity clut and configuring the GPU for identity pixel passthrough,  
    and [RestoreCluts](RestoreCluts), which restores to the state before  
    [LoadIdentityClut](LoadIdentityClut)(). I think "[sca](sca)" calls that, as well as showing the  
    cursor and other cleanup actions.  
  
    [LoadIdentityClut](LoadIdentityClut) is also automatically called by [PsychImaging](PsychImaging) etc. if  
    the image processing pipeline is used for  
    Bits++/Datapixx/Viewpixx,video attenuators etc.  
  
    It is important to always use [LoadIdentityClut](LoadIdentityClut)() instead of self-made  
    code. Many (most?) graphics cards on most operating systems have  
    graphics driver bugs and hardware quirks which cause the self-made  
    identity clut to actually not turn out to be an identity clut in the  
    hardware. [LoadIdentityClut](LoadIdentityClut)() has heuristics to detect os/gpu combo  
    and select an appropriately fudged lut to actually get an identity  
    mapping. In case of new hardware with new quirks we should update  
    that files detection logic to cope. Additionally there is  
    [SaveIdentityClut](SaveIdentityClut)() to save a known good lut for automatic use with  
    [LoadIdentityClut](LoadIdentityClut), overriding its choice. And there is  
    [BitsPlusIdentityClutTest](BitsPlusIdentityClutTest) to test a Bits+ or Datapixx device  
    thoroughly for problems and aid in fixing them. It is easy to get  
    fooled into thinking you got it right, even when using a photometer,  
    because some of the problems are subtle and not detectable without  
    use of dynamic test patterns like in [BitsPlusIdentityClutTest](BitsPlusIdentityClutTest) with  
    Mono++ mode, or special debug functionality as in the  
    [DataPixx](DataPixx)/[ViewPixx](ViewPixx) devices.  
  
    I use a [DataPixx](DataPixx) to test such stuff and PTB has builtin diagnostic to  
    utilize that hardware to make sure that the video signal is really  
    untampered.  
  
    [LoadIdentityClut](LoadIdentityClut) also calls special functions in [Screen](Screen) that try to  
    workaround or fix other hardware interference. E.g., in addition to  
    cluts messing with pixel passthrough, there is also display dithering  
    on any digital video output, and some new pre- and post-gamma  
    corrections in latest generation hardware -- [Screen](Screen) can fix this for  
    some cards on some operating systems, but only when used through  
    [LoadIdentityClut](LoadIdentityClut).  
  
    E.g., almost all AMD cards will cause trouble on OSX when the  
    [PsychtoolboxKernelDriver](PsychtoolboxKernelDriver) and [LoadIdentityClut](LoadIdentityClut) etc. is not used,  
    almost all [NVidia](NVidia) cards on OSX will cause trouble unless you use some  
    special [NVidia](NVidia) kernel driver which is somewhere referenced on the  
    Bits+ pages on our wiki. We have/need similar hacks on Windows, e.g.,  
    [PsychGPUControl](PsychGPUControl)() for AMD cards. On Linux either PTB's low-level  
    fixes apply or they are not neccessary.  
  
    So the [CalibrateMonSpd](CalibrateMonSpd) etc. should be fixed to use  
    [LoadIdentityClut](LoadIdentityClut)/[RestoreCluts](RestoreCluts), everything else is just begging for  
    trouble.
