[cal, cals, fullFilename] = [LoadCalFile](LoadCalFile)([filespec], [whichCal], [dir], [noWarning])  
  
Load calibration data from saved file in the [CalData](CalData) folder.  
Will search one level deep in the [CalData](CalData) folder if the  
file does not exist at the top level, but skips subdirs  
called 'xOld', 'Plots', and those that begin with '.'.  
  
If no argument is given, loads from file default.mat.  If  
an integer N is passed, loads from file screenN.mat.  If  
a string S is given, loads from S.mat.  You can pass the  
trailing .mat as well and it will still work.  
  
If whichCal is specified, the whichCal'th calibration  
in the file is returned.  If whichCal \> nCals, an  
empty calibration is returned.  whichCal defaults  
to the most recent calibration, if not passed or passed  
as the empty matrix.  You can also pass Inf for whichCal  
to get the most recent calibration.  
  
If the specified file cannot be found, returns empty matrix.  
  
The returned variable cal is a structure containing calibration  
information.  
  
The returned cell array cals contains all of the calibrations  
stored in the file  
  
The returned string fullFilename is the full path to the calibration  
file.

5/28/96  dgp  Wrote it.  
6/6/96   dgp  Use [CalibrationsFolder](CalibrationsFolder).  
6/6/96   dgp  Use whole path in filename so Matlab will only look there.  
7/25/96  dgp  Use [CalDataFolder](CalDataFolder).  
8/4/96   dhb  More flexible filename interface.  
8/21/97  dhb  Rewrite for calibrations stored as cell array.  
              Optional return of entire calibration history.  
8/26/97  dhb  Handle case of isempty(cals).  
              Added whichCal argument.  
5/18/99  dhb  Added dir argument.  
8/15/00  dhb  Modify to handle local/demo cal directories.  
4/2/13   dhb  Updated for subdir searching logic.  
6/2/13   dhb  More robust about whether passed filespec contains the trailing '.mat'.  
7/3/13   dhb  Fix buglet for check on trailing .mat when length of filename less than 4 chars.  
12/11/14 dhb  Use fullfile rather than straight append to build up full path to cal file.  
10/23/15 dhb  Suppress warning about enumeration being converted to  
              struct on load.  This can happen when the cal struct contains a field  
              that is an ennumeration, but is, I think, OK.
