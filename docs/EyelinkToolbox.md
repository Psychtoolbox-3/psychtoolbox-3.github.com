[EyelinkToolbox](EyelinkToolbox).  
  
The [EyelinkToolbox](EyelinkToolbox) can be used to ceate eye-movement experiments and  
control the SR-Research Eyelink(c) gazetrackers  
(http://www.eyelinkinfo.com/) from within Matlab and Octave.  
  
It is incorporated into the [PsychToolbox](PsychToolbox) (http://www.psychtoolbox.org/).  
  
It provides an interface to the Eyelink Gazetracker.  
  
It uses a very similar  approach as the [PsychToolBox](PsychToolBox) and uses the  
functions provided by the [PsychToolBox](PsychToolBox) for graphics and sound.  
  
### How to start using it:  
  
The [EyelinkToolbox](EyelinkToolbox) is a collection of m-files and a Mex file.  
The [EyelinkToolbox](EyelinkToolbox) core is the mex/dll-file called Eyelink. The  
[EyelinkToolbox](EyelinkToolbox) uses the same approach as the SCREEN mex/dll function  
provided in the [PsychToolBox](PsychToolBox). Most of the Eyelink functions that are  
avaible in C are also available under Matlab. In addition, the  
[EyelinkToolbox](EyelinkToolbox) provides a number of wrapper functions to simplify  
creating an eye-tracking program. The main functionality of the   
[EyelinkToolbox](EyelinkToolbox) is demonstrated in a number of demos. This is probably  
where you want to start if you are new to the [EyelinkToolbox](EyelinkToolbox).  
  
To use Eyelink, you must also install the SR-Research runtime libraries,  
downloadable from the Support Section of their website (see above).  
  
For a complete list of available functions type "Eyelink" in the  
command window. For an explanation of any particular eyelink function  
just add a question mark "?" after a command. E.g. for help on the   
function 'Initialize', try either of these equivalent forms:  
  
Eyelink('Initialize?')  
Eyelink Initialize?  
  
### Contents of the [EyelinkToolbox](EyelinkToolbox) folder:  
  
-Contents.m: this file.  
  
-Changes.m: file that documents changes to the [EyelinkToolbox](EyelinkToolbox)  
  
-[EyelinkBasic](EyelinkBasic)  
Eyelink mex files and a collection of m-files that provide the  
core functionality of the toolbox.  
  
-[EyelinkDemos](EyelinkDemos)  
[EyelinkShortDemos](EyelinkShortDemos) is the best place to start. Contains relatively   
simple demos. The SR-Research Demo folder is a slightly more  
elaborate example. The folder BRMIC contains the original example  
as shown in the [EyelinkToolbox](EyelinkToolbox) article in BRMIC (Cornelissen,  
Peters and Palmer 2002). It is obsolete in many ways but left in  
the toolbox for historic reasons.  
  
-[EyelinkOneLiners](EyelinkOneLiners)  
Handy routines that provide less essential functionality  
  
We welcome any observations, suggestions that may help us improve this  
toolbox. If any particular function you need is still missing, let us know  
and we'll try to incorporate it into a next release. In case you decide  
to add or modify functions yourself, please send us the modified code.  
If you think you've found a bug, please tell us. It will help greatly  
if you can supply a  minimal-length program that exhibits the bug.  
If you're interested in the c-source code of this project, it is part  
of the source code of the [PsychToolbox](PsychToolbox) (http://www.psychtoolbox.org/).  
  
\*\*\*\*\*\*Citing the use of the Eyelink Toolbox\*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
We would very much appreciate it if you would (also) cite the [EyelinkToolbox](EyelinkToolbox)  
paper when you have used the toolbox in your work. You could write something  
like:  
  
We wrote our experiments in Matlab, using the Psychophysics and Eyelink  
Toolbox extensions (Kleiner 2007; Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997; Cornelissen,  
Peters & Palmer, 2002; see http://psychtoolbox.org).

This toolbox is also actively supported and co-developed by SR-Research  
(http://www.eyelinkinfo.com), the manufacturer of the Eyelink  
gazetrackers. You can contact them about it. However, if your problem  
is likely of interest to other users as well, then please post  
questions on the [PsychToolbox](PsychToolbox) mailinglist, which is also monitored by  
SR-Research.
