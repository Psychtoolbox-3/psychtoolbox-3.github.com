This folder holds colorimetric data in .mat file form.  
All data files are in a standard format.  
  
A very useful source for on-line  
colorimetric data is the CVRL database:   
  http://cvrl.ioo.ucl.ac.uk/  
Many of the functions used here were downloaded from  
that source and then splined to the wavelength sampling  
used here (with extension by zeros).  
  
  B\_xxx files contain basis functions.  The basis functions themselves  
    are in the columns of a matrix with name B\_xxx.  There is also  
    a 3 by 1 row vector S\_xxx that contains the wavelength sampling  
    information in the form [start delta numberSamples] where start  
    and delta are in nanometers.  
  
  den\_xxx files contain optical density data.  In log units.  To  
    convert density values to transmittance, take 10^(-den).  There  
    is also an S\_xxx vector.  Curiously, these are in column vectors  
    in the .mat files.  
  
  spd\_xxx files contain spectral power distributions.  Data are in  
    columns of matrix with name spd\_xxx.  There is also a S\_xxx  
    vector.  
  
  sur\_xxx files contain surface reflectance functions (range 0-1).  Data  
    are in columns of matrix with name sur\_xxx.  There is also an S\_xxx  
    vector.  
  
  T\_xxx contain color matching functions or spectral sensitivities.  Data  
     are in rows of a matrix with name T\_xxx.  There is also an S\_xxx  
     vector.  All are in energy units, so that multiplying by spectra in  
     energy (not quanta) gives desired result (often proportional to  
     isomerization rate).  
  
 Specific data files are listed below.  Most, but not all, are sampled  
 between 380 nm and 780 nm at 5 nm intervals (S = [380 5 81]).  This is  
 the CIE standard.  Good coding practice requires using the S\_xxx vector  
 loaded with the data and splining to the wavelength sampling you want to work  
 in.  If I were to start this database again, I would have kept each function  
 at the resolution of its source.  
  
 In some cases, the original data were interpolated or extraploated (with zeros)  
 to put them data onto the CIE standard [380 5 81] wavelength.
