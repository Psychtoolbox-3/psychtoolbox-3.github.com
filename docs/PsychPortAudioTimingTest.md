[PsychPortAudioTimingTest](PsychPortAudioTimingTest)([exactstart=1][, deviceid=-1][, latbias=0][, waitframes][, useDPixx=0][, triggerLevel=0.01][, reqlatencyclass=2])  
  
Test script for sound onset timing reliability and sound onset  
latency of the [PsychPortAudio](PsychPortAudio) sound driver.  
  
This script configures the driver for low latency and high timing  
precision, then executes ten trials where it tries to emit a beep sound,  
starting in exact sync to a black-white transition on the display.  
  
You'll need measurement equipment to use this: A photo-diode attached to  
the top-left corner of your CRT display, a microphone attached to your  
speakers, some oszillograph to record and measure the signals from the  
diode and microphone.  
  
Some parameters may need tweaking. Make sure you got a setup as described  
in 'help InitializePsychSound' for best results.  
  
### Optional parameters:  
  
'exactstart' = 0 -- Start immediately, measure absolute latency.  
             = 1 -- Test accuracy of scheduled sound onset. (Default)  
  
'deviceid'   = -1 -- Auto-select optimal device (Default).  
            \>=0   -- Select specified output device. See  
                     [PsychPortAudio](PsychPortAudio)('GetDevices') for a list of devices.  
  
'latbias'    = Hardware inherent latency bias. To be determined by  
               measurement - allows to PA to correct for it if provided.  
               Unit is seconds. Defaults to zero.  
  
'waitframes' = Time to wait (in video refresh intervals) before emitting beep + flash.  
               Defaults to a typically safe value if omitted.  
  
'useDPixx'   = 1 -- Use [DataPixx](DataPixx) device to automatically measure the true  
                    audio onset time wrt. to visual stimulus onset.  
               0 -- Don't use [DataPixx](DataPixx). This is the default.  
  
'triggerLevel' = Sound signal amplitude for [DataPixx](DataPixx) to detect sound  
                 onset. Defaults to 0.01 = 1% of max amplitude if  
                 exactstart == 0, otherwise it is auto-detected by  
                 calibration. This will likely need tweaking on your  
                 setup. If the measured audio onset delta by [DataPixx](DataPixx) is  
                 much lower (or almost zero) than the expected delta  
                 reported by [PsychPortAudio](PsychPortAudio), then the triggerLevel may be  
                 too low and you should try if slightly higher thresholds  
                 help to discriminate signal from noise. Too high values  
                 may cause a hang of the script. In practice, levels  
                 between 0.01 and 0.1 should yield good results. Setting  
                 the 'useDPixx' flag to 2 also plots the waveforms  
                 captured by [DataPixx](DataPixx), which may help in selection of the  
                 optimal triggerLevel.  
  
'reqlatencyclass' Override setting for reqlatencyclass parameter. By default,  
                  reqlatencyclass = 2 is used, for exclusive device access for  
                  low latency / high timing precision mode.
