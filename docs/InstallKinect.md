[InstallKinect](InstallKinect) - Kinect driver installation instructions.  
  
# MS-Windows  
  
Psychtoolbox on Windows currently only supports the original XBOX-360 Kinect,  
not the more recent versions of "Kinect for Windows". Use GNU/Linux if you want  
to use those.  
  
1. Unzip the file Psychtoolbox/[PsychContributed](PsychContributed)/Kinect-v16-[WindowsDrivers](WindowsDrivers).zip  
   into a temporary folder, e.g., C:\tmp\[KinectDrivers](KinectDrivers).  
  
2. Plug in your Kinect box into a USB port via the interface cable.  
  
3. The Windows hardware setup assistant will start, tell you about new  
   detected hardware and ask you for drivers. Say "No" to the  
   "automatically search for drivers" option, but select to "provide your  
   own drivers". In the next tab, select "browse for drivers", and then  
   select the temporary folder with the unzipped file (from step 1) as  
   driver folder. Press ok.  
  
4. The driver will be installed from the zip file, the device manager  
   will notify you of the new device, then prompt you for installation  
   of another device. Repeat the same procedure from step 3 until no more  
   devices need to be installed. This procedure will repeat three to four  
   times until all drivers are installed, as the Kinect shows up as  
   multiple separate devices (Video camera, Audio soundcard and  
   Kinect motor).  
  
5. The setup assistant will tell you that your new device is fully  
   operational. Quit the assistant.  
  
6. Unplug the Kinect, wait a few seconds, plug it in again, just to be  
   sure it is correctly detected.  
  
7. Now you can start Matlab or Octave and use the Kinect! Try [KinectDemo](KinectDemo)  
   and [Kinect3DDemo](Kinect3DDemo) for a start, then delve into your own Kinect adventures.  
  
The current Kinect low level drivers are still early prototypes, so  
expect occasional bugs or weird behaviour.  
  
  
# GNU/Linux  
  
If you use the Psychtoolbox distribution provided by the [NeuroDebian](NeuroDebian)  
project (http://neuro.debian.net) there's nothing to do. It should "just  
work(tm)", well almost: Skip to step 2. Otherwise the following step 1  
is required:  
  
1. If you have Ubuntu Linux 10.04 LTS or later installed, open a terminal  
window and type this sequence of commands, providing your administrator  
password as requested. (Same procedure for Debian 4.0 or later)  
  
   a) Add the [NeuroDebian](NeuroDebian) repository to your software sources, as described  
      at http://neuro.debian.net\#how-to-use-this-repository  
   b) sudo apt-get update  
   c) sudo apt-get install freenect  
   d) sudo adduser YOURNAME video  
      --\> (YOURNAME) is your user login name!  
   e) Log out and Log in again.  
  
For non-Debian or non-Ubuntu Linux distributions, you'll need to install  
a version of libfreenect that is compatible to version 0.1.2 via whatever  
means your system provides to do this. If you want to also use the Kinect for  
Windows, instead of only the "original" XBOX-360 kinect, then you will need  
libfreenect version 0.2 or later. Using version 0.2 or later of libfreenect  
will also allow you to skip the following setup step 2:  
  
2. Kinect is now usable from within Matlab or Octave. Well almost.  
Systems with Linux kernel version 3.0 or later can use the video camera  
and microphones of the Kinect as regular sound and video devices, e.g.,  
for use by the Psychtoolbox videocapture and recording functions or other  
video apps (Skype, etc.). This however blocks use of the Kinect by our  
[PsychKinect](PsychKinect)() driver. If you want the Kinect as 3D depths camera with  
our driver or other Kinect-specific software, you need to disable the  
standard Linux kinect driver "gspca\_kinect" by black-listing it. On  
Ubuntu Linux (and probably most other distributions) you can do this  
by copying the file linux\_blacklist\_kinectvideo from Psychtoolboxs  
[PsychContributed](PsychContributed) folder to Linux /etc/modprobe.d/ directory as a root  
user. This is most simply done by executing this function [InstallKinect](InstallKinect),  
and blindly entering your password while logged in as a user with  
administrator rights (as the script calls the sudo command).  
  
3. After this procedure, the Kinect should be fully usable by Psychtoolbox.  
  
  
# Mac OS/X  
  
See the OS/X section at http://openkinect.org/wiki/Getting\_Started  
You will need libfreenect version 0.1.2 or compatible for this to work.  
  
The easiest way to get these libraries on OSX is via Homebrew.  
Get it at: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew  
  
Once Homebrew is installed, one first needs to "brew install automake",  
and "brew install autoconfig", and potentially cmake before one can  
"brew install libfreenect".  
  
If you want to also use the Kinect for Windows, instead of only the  
"original" XBOX-360 kinect, then you will need libfreenect version 0.3 or  
later.  
  
[PsychKinectCore](PsychKinectCore) links dynamically against those two libraries. We don't  
distribute them for now, as that would require us to distribute the  
corresponding source code of libusb-1.0.0 as well due to [LGPLv2](LGPLv2)  
requirements.  
  
  
# CAVEATS  
  
This is still early prototype software, expect bugs, bumps and hickups.  
  
The Kinect driver has been successfully tested with "Microsoft [XBox](XBox)  
Kinect". This version doesn't yet work with "Microsoft Kinect for  
Windows", due to lack of support in the libfreenect-0.1.2 library.

Licenses: The driver consists of multiple components, which are licensed  
under different free software / open source licenses. The drivers are  
developed and licensed to you by their respective developers, the members  
of the [OpenKinect](OpenKinect) community. See the respective web sites and licenses  
for copyright, authors, credits etc.:  
  
libusb - The underlying USB communication library is licensed under LGPL.  
libfreenect - The Kinect driver is dual-licensed (at your option) under  
[GPLv2](GPLv2) or Apache license.  
  
The source code of the Windows version of the Kinect driver and libusb  
can be found after checking out Psychtoolbox's C source code from our GIT  
repository (see "help [UseTheSource](UseTheSource)" for instructions) as a zip file  
under:  
  
Psychtoolbox-3/[PsychSourceGL](PsychSourceGL)/Cohorts/Kinect-v16-withsource.zip  
  
The source code for libfreenect (Unix aka Linux / [MacOS](MacOS)/X) can be found  
under:
