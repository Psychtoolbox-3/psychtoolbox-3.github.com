[M,[LMLumWeights](LMLumWeights)] = [ComputeDKL](ComputeDKL)\_M(bg,T\_cones,T\_Y)  
  
Compute the matrix that converts between incremental cone  
coordinates and DKL space.  The order of  
the coordinates in the DKL column vectors is (Lum, RG, S)  
  
The code follows that published by Brainard  
as an appendix to Human Color Vision by Kaiser  
and Boynton, but has been generalized to work  
for passed cone fundamentals and luminosity   
function.  
  
These should be passed in standard Psychtoolbox  
form (LMS in rows of T\_cones; luminosity function  
as single row vector T\_Y).  
  
The argument bg is the LMS cone coordinates of the  
background that defines the space.  
  
See [[DKLDemo](DKLDemo)][(DKLDemo)]((DKLDemo)) for proper use of this function.  Also  
[DKLToConeInc](DKLToConeInc) and [ConeIncToDKL](ConeIncToDKL).  
  
8/30/96   dhb  Pulled it out.  
4/9/05    dhb  Allow passing of cones and luminance to be used.  
11/17/05  dhb  Require passing of cones and luminance.  
          dhb  Fixed definition of M\_raw to handle arbitrary L,M scaling.  
10/5/12   dhb  Comment specifying coordinate system convention.  Supress extraneous printout.  
04/13/17  dhb  Return weights that give luminance from sum of L and M cone excitations.  
08/20/21  dhb  Added check of a direct method of computing M, provided by Supi Ray (sray@iisc.ac.in).  
               The check is commented out at the end of this routine, but  
               does indeed give the same answer in the limited cases I've  
               checked. At the heart of the derivation is analytic  
               inversion of M\_raw.  I imagine that Ray would be happy to  
               provide the derivation if asked.
