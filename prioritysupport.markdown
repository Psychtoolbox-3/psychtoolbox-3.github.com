 If you require priority support regarding Psychtoolbox, go to the
 following commercial companion website to buy such services from us:

 [https://www.psychtoolbox.net][commercialsite]

 For priority support on our user forum or on our GitHub issue tracker, buy a
 "community membership with priority support" from there.

 1. As part of your purchase, you will receive a document with a printed
    "Order Id" and a printed "License key".

 2. Next you can run the Psychtoolbox function PsychPaidSupportAndServices in Octave
    or Matlab. The function will ask you if you need priority support and do have
    an active license key to prove your community membership. Answer "y" for yes.

 3. Next the function will ask you about your "Order Id" and "License key".
    Please enter that info that you got from step 1.

 4. The function will print out an "authentication token", a string of letters and
    numbers. [Now you can post your question on the Psychtoolbox user forum][forum]
    or [open a new issue for bugs and feature requests on our GitHub issue tracker][issues].

    Please add the "authentication token" to your forum question or GitHub issue.
    This will prove to us that you deserve priority support for your question or
    issue. Please note that initial activation of your license key may take 5-10
    days after date of purchase, so do not buy the priority support last minute,
    when the "house is already burning", but ahead of time, like you would do
    with a fire insurance.
