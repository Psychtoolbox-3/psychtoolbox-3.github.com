At 28th October 2019, YahooGroups started the shutdown
of its forum groups, including the Psychtoolbox user
forum.

From now on, no new questions or replies can be posted
to the public forum website. All existing content will
be deleted starting 14th December.

The shutdown of Yahoo's services happened on such short
notice that we didn't have time to prepare in advance.

[For bug reports and feature requests, go to our Issue
tracker by clicking this link](https://github.com/Psychtoolbox-3/Psychtoolbox-3/issues)

We are working to find a new home for the forum and
will let you know here when it is ready.
