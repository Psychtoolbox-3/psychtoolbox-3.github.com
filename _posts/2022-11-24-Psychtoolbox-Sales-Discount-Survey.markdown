Dear Psychtoolbox users,

starting today, November 24th 2022, and only for a limited amount of time,
we are offering you a heavily discounted end of year sale of our Psychtoolbox
paid support membership licenses, for a substantially reduced price of only
99 Euros (plus tax), instead of the regular 150 Euros for a 12 months membership license!

Buying such a license once a year is a good way to support Psychtoolbox continued
existence and health, and also the potential needs of your lab for expert support.

[Buy a discounted license under this link: https://www.psychtoolbox.net/#service](https://www.psychtoolbox.net/#service)

For an overview of what larger improvements have been made to Psychtoolbox over
the last two years, its continued popularity and importance to the field, and
also about our urgent need for financial support by our users, [please watch
Celia Fosters talk from VSS 2022 under this link.](https://youtu.be/afKbkOx62dQ)

As you can see from that presentation, in recent years the Psychtoolbox Team has
worked hard to improve Psychtoolbox itself and its services on Psychtoolbox.net.
We also kindly ask you to fill out our current user survey if your lab has not
done so already, so that we can better understand the needs and wishes of our
community. So far participation has been too low.

The survey is conducted by our host for all commercial services and matters, the
["Medical Innovations Incubator GmbH, Tuebingen, Germany"](https://mi-incubator.com).

As a thank you, you will receive a discount code for your next
[Psychtoolbox Support Membership purchase](https://www.psychtoolbox.net/#service).

Many Thanks for your support and stay healthy!

Mario, Dee, Celia, Ingo and Anna
