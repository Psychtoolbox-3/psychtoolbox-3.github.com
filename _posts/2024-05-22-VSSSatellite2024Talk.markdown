Celia's Psychtoolbox 2024 update presentation from last Monday at VSS 2024
is now available on YouTube in Celia's channel. It was part of the satellite
event about "Psychophysics Software with Matlab", organized by Mathworks with
support from INCF.

This year, Mathworks chose a title for the satellite that attracted an audience
bigger than the 8 or so people that showed up last time, estimates from people
in the room suggest about 50 participants.

The new presentation is here:

Commenting, questions etc. wrt. to the presentation should probably be
directed at the user forum here:

<https://psychtoolbox.discourse.group/t/psychtoolbox-talk-at-vss-2024-satellite-on-psychophysics-software-with-matlab/5352/3>

I don't know when the rest of the presentations, e.g., from PsychBench and
VPixx and INCF and Mathworks, as well as the Q & A, will become available,
as that is done by Mathworks or INCF.

For reference, Celia's past presentation from VSS 2022 can be watched here:
