Happy new year!

Our user forum has been resurrected at its new home
at Discourse:

[Link to new forum at Discourse](https://psychtoolbox.discourse.group)

This is a way more polished and featureful discussion group system, so it should
also provide improved usability. We have to figure out all the new bells and
whistles ourselves over time, but all the basics should be ready.

People signed up to the old forum may have to (re-)sign up for the new Discourse
forum. Much of the old content from the old YahooGroups forum has been imported
into the new forum.

Yahoo has by now deleted all forum content from the old forum, so that one is as
dead as it can be - you can delete your bookmarks to it, and R.I.P.

As some stats: The old Yahoo Groups forum had 2,810 subscribers at the time of
its shutdown by Yahoo at the end of October 2019, and received 24136 messages
during its lifetime from 17th January 2000 to 28th October 2019. We hope the new
forum will show as much user engagement, now that it is reestablished!

Hip hip hurray, and post away!
