Since a week or so, we have a Twitter account, which is not managed by myself - I donâ€™t do Twitter,
but people more competent at social media, with bits of content provided among others, by myself
and my neuroscientist girlfriend. E.g., PTB news announcements, little technical tips, calls to
action.

We hope you will find it interesting and that it opens up another communication channel to
Psychtoolbox users and (hopefully) future supporters beyond the audience that frequents the
discussion forum.

Twitter handle: @psychtoolbox
Account: <https://twitter.com/psychtoolbox>

Please retweet and share, and have a nice weekend,
-Team Psychtoolbox
