This release contains some minor improvements for Linux, and in the future for Windows.

## Linux

- Fix AUX buffer fallback in Screen, so MSAA anti-aliasing can be used again without full imaging-pipeline enabled. This was broken due to changes of AUX buffer support in graphics drivers over the last decade. The same fix applies to MS-Windows, but we can't do a full rebuild of Screen on Windows atm., only for Octave, so this is only "inofficially" fixed for now on Octave + Windows.
- LinesDemo.m: Request 1xMSAA, so drawing of anti-aliased lines works with nice perpendicular endcaps on AMD + Linux on future Mesa 22.0 and later, e.g., likely on upcoming Ubuntu 22.04-LTS.
