Celia Foster was giving a 12 minute quick presentation about what's new
in Psychtoolbox since the last update at VSS 2019, as part of the
Mathworks/INCF 1 hour session. Videos of much of that session may become
available later, after editing/cutting etc.

For now, a video of Celia's practice talk, only containing the 12 minute
Psychtoolbox bit, without Q & A, is available on YouTube under this link:

Thanks to Mathworks, INCF and the volunteers in the room for hosting
this session.

Enjoy!

Celia & Mario
