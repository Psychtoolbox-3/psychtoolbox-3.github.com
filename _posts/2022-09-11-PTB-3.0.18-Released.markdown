As usual, the complete development history can be found in our GitHub repository.
The release tag is “3.0.18.13”, with the full tree and commit logs under the URL:

<https://github.com/Psychtoolbox-3/Psychtoolbox-3/tree/3.0.18.13>

A very minor update. Barely worth proper release announcements.

### macOS:

- Minor improvements to PsychHID troubleshooting help texts for macOS security GUI bugs.

### Windows:

- Point out need for GStreamer 1.18 instead of GStreamer 1.20 more clearly.
