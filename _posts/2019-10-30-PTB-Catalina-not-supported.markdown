A friendly note to all members of the church of Apple.

macOS 10.15.0 "Catalina" is not supported by current
Psychtoolbox, due to a number of new entertaining
bugs introduced by the iToys company into their
latest trainwreck.

Upgrading to Linux is generally recommended for
generally more reliable and trustworthy data collection.
